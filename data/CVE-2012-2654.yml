cve: CVE-2012-2654
description: The (1) EC2 and (2) OS APIs in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom (2012.2),
  Essex (2012.1), and Diablo (2011.3) do not properly check the protocol when security
  groups are created and the network protocol is not specified entirely in lowercase,
  which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
