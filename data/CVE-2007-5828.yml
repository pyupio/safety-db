cve: CVE-2007-5828
description: '** DISPUTED **  Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the
  admin panel in Django 0.96 allows remote attackers to change passwords of arbitrary
  users via a request to admin/auth/user/1/password/.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
  by Debian, since product documentation includes a recommendation for a CSRF protection
  module that is included with the product.  However, CVE considers this an issue
  because the default configuration does not use this module.'
