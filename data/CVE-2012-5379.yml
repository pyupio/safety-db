cve: CVE-2012-5379
description: '** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation
  functionality in ActivePython 3.2.2.3, when installed in the top-level C:\ directory,
  might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\Python27
  or C:\Python27\Scripts directory, which may be added to the PATH system environment
  variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file
  used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista
  SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.  NOTE:
  CVE disputes this issue because the unsafe PATH is established only by a separate
  administrative action that is not a default part of the ActivePython installation.'
