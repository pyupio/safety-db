This removes the httplib dependency for this module while fixing\n  some bugs related to redirects and SSL certs.\n* Fixed some bugs related to the incorrect creation of extra temp directories for\n  uploading files, which were not cleaned up properly.\n* Improved error reporting in certain situations, to provide more information such as\n  the playbook file/line.\n* Fixed a bug related to the variable precedence of role parameters, especially when\n  a role may be used both as a dependency of a role and directly by itself within the\n  same play.\n* Fixed some bugs in the 2.0 implementation of do/until.\n* Fixed some bugs related to run_once:\n  - Ensure that all hosts are marked as failed if a task marked as run_once fails.\n  - Show a warning when using the free strategy when a run_once task is encountered, as\n    there is no way for the free strategy to guarantee the task is not run more than once.\n* Fixed a bug where the assemble module was not honoring check mode in some situations.\n* Fixed a bug related to delegate_to, where we were incorrectly using variables from\n  the inventory host rather than the delegated-to host.\n* The 'package' meta-module now properly squashes items down to a single execution (as the\n  apt/yum/other package modules do).\n* Fixed a bug related to the ansible-galaxy CLI command dealing with paged results from\n  the Galaxy server.\n* Pipelining support is now available for the local and jail connection plugins, which is\n  useful for users who do not wish to have temp files/directories created when running\n  tasks with these connection types.\n* Improvements in support for additional shell types.\n* Improvements in the code which is used to calculate checksums for remote files.\n* Some speed ups and bug fixes related to the variable merging code.\n* Workaround bug in python subprocess on El Capitan that was making vault fail\n  when attempting to encrypt a file\n* Fix lxc_container module having predictable temp file names and setting file\n  permissions on the temporary file too leniently on a temporary file that was\n  executed as a script.  Addresses CVE-2016-3096\n* Fix a bug in the uri module where setting headers via module params that\n  start with HEADER_ were causing a traceback.\n* Fix bug in the free strategy that was causing it to synchronize its workers\n  after every task (making it a lot more like linear than it should have been).\n\n",

Merge sanitizer.sanitize into the\n  sanitizer.htmlsanitizer module and move that to saniziter. This means\n  anyone who used sanitizer.sanitize or sanitizer.HTMLSanitizer needs no\n  code changes.**\n\n* **Rename treewalkers.lxmletree to .etree_lxml and\n  treewalkers.genshistream to .genshi to have a consistent API.**\n\n* Move a whole load of stuff (inputstream, ihatexml, trie, tokenizer,\n  utils) to be underscore prefixed to clarify their status as private.\n\n\n",

This experimental functionality is currently\n  only enabled if  the ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER`` environment variable is set to\n  \"natural\". In the future, this behavior may become default, but only after\n  it has matured and seen substantial adoption. The ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER``\n  also accepts \"executable\" to force the default behavior of creating launcher\n  executables.\n* Issue 63: Bootstrap script (ez_setup.py) now prefers Powershell, curl, or\n  wget for retrieving the Setuptools tarball for improved security of the\n  install. The script will still fall back to a simple ``urlopen`` on\n  platforms that do not have these tools.\n* Issue 65: Deprecated the ``Features`` functionality.\n* Issue 52: In ``VerifyingHTTPSConn``, handle a tunnelled (proxied)\n  connection.\n\nBackward-Incompatible Changes\n=============================\n\nThis release includes a couple of backward-incompatible changes, but most if\nnot all users will find 1.0 a drop-in replacement for 0.9.\n\n* Issue 50: Normalized API of environment marker support. Specifically,\n  removed line number and filename from SyntaxErrors when returned from\n  `pkg_resources.invalid_marker`. Any clients depending on the specific\n  string representation of exceptions returned by that function may need to\n  be updated to account for this change.\n* Issue 50: SyntaxErrors generated by `pkg_resources.invalid_marker` are\n  normalized for cross-implementation consistency.\n* Removed ``--ignore-conflicts-at-my-risk`` and ``--delete-conflicting``\n  options to easy_install. These options have been deprecated since 0.6a11.\n\n",

That is, the mere\n  declaration of a namespace package in an egg on ``sys.path`` no longer\n  causes it to be imported when ``pkg_resources`` is imported. Note that this\n  change means that all of a namespace package's ``__init__.py`` files must\n  include a ``declare_namespace()`` call in order to ensure that they will be\n  handled properly at runtime. In 2.x it was possible to get away without\n  including the declaration, but only at the cost of forcing namespace\n  packages to be imported early, which 3.0 no longer does.\n* Issue 148: When building (bdist_egg), setuptools no longer adds\n  ``__init__.py`` files to namespace packages. Any packages that rely on this\n  behavior will need to create ``__init__.py`` files and include the\n  ``declare_namespace()``.\n* Issue 7: Setuptools itself is now distributed as a zip archive in addition to\n  tar archive. ez_setup.py now uses zip archive. This approach avoids the potential\n  security vulnerabilities presented by use of tar archives in ez_setup.py.\n  It also leverages the security features added to ZipFile.extract in Python 2.7.4.\n* Issue 65: Removed deprecated Features functionality.\n* BB Pull Request 28: Remove backport of ``_bytecode_filenames`` which is\n  available in Python 2.6 and later, but also has better compatibility with\n  Python 3 environments.\n* Issue 156: Fix spelling of __PYVENV_LAUNCHER__ variable.\n\n",

Release of 2.10 was clobbered\n  due to what looks like a merge at r74790.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Update plone2.5_template's buildout.cfg_tmpl to use Zope 2.9.10. This\n  release incorporates Hotfix-2008-08-12. Defaulting to a known insecure\n  Zope seems unwise for people that may be updating legacy environments into\n  buildout, since they're likely to forget to include the hotfix. Url to\n  2.9.10 hard-coded (as opposed to the more elegantly self-aware\n  plone.recipe.plone approach) per the practice of a plone.recipe.distros\n  plone part.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Nearly at the end of the creation of a ZopeSkel template, the local\n  commands available for that template are displayed.\n  [jaraco, markvl]\n\n* The Plone template now has local commands. (Basically moved them\n  from the archetype templates to plone templates and made them\n  available for both.\n  [markvl]\n\n* Added base test setup to the archetype template. Added wiring code that\n  runs README.txt as a doctest.\n  [esartor]\n\n* Added tests to the addcontent contenttype command. These ammend the\n  README.txt file for each content type providing basic tests for creating,\n  editing and removing instances of the added content type.\n  [esartor]\n\n\n",
