            "changelog": "========================\nDjango 1.8 release notes\n========================\n\n*April 1, 2015*\n\nWelcome to Django 1.8!\n\nThese release notes cover the :ref:`new features <whats-new-1.8>`, as well as\nsome :ref:`backwards incompatible changes <backwards-incompatible-1.8>` you'll\nwant to be aware of when upgrading from Django 1.7 or older versions. We've\nalso :ref:`begun the deprecation process for some features\n<deprecated-features-1.8>`, and some features have reached the end of their\ndeprecation process and :ref:`have been removed <removed-features-1.8>`.\n\nSee the :doc:`/howto/upgrade-version` guide if you're updating an existing\nproject.\n\nDjango 1.8 has been designated as Django's second :term:`long-term support\nrelease`. It will receive security updates for at least three years after its\nrelease. Support for the previous LTS, Django 1.4, will end 6 months from the\nrelease date of Django 1.8.\n\nPython compatibility\n====================\n\nDjango 1.8 requires Python 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5. We **highly recommend**\nand only officially support the latest release of each series.\n\nDjango 1.8 is the first release to support Python 3.5.\n\nDue to the end of upstream support for Python 3.2 in February 2016, we won't\ntest Django 1.8.x on Python 3.2 after the end of 2016.\n\n.. _whats-new-1.8:\n\nWhat's new in Django 1.8\n========================\n\n``Model._meta`` API\n-------------------\n\nDjango now has a formalized API for :doc:`Model._meta </ref/models/meta>`,\nproviding an officially supported way to :ref:`retrieve fields\n<model-meta-field-api>` and filter fields based on their :ref:`attributes\n<model-field-attributes>`.\n\nThe ``Model._meta`` object has been part of Django since the days of pre-0.96\n\"Magic Removal\" -- it just wasn't an official, stable API. In recognition of\nthis, we've endeavored to maintain backwards-compatibility with the old\nAPI endpoint where possible. However, API endpoints that aren't part of the\nnew official API have been deprecated and will eventually be removed. A\n:ref:`guide to migrating from the old API to the new API\n<migrating-old-meta-api>` has been provided.\n\nMultiple template engines\n-------------------------\n\nDjango 1.8 defines a stable API for integrating template backends. It includes\nbuilt-in support for the Django template language and for\n:class:`~django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2`. It supports rendering\ntemplates with multiple engines within the same project. Learn more about the\nnew features in the :doc:`topic guide </topics/templates>` and check the\n:doc:`upgrade instructions </ref/templates/upgrading>` for details.\n\nSecurity enhancements\n---------------------\n\nSeveral features of the django-secure_ third-party library have been\nintegrated into Django. :class:`django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware`\nprovides several security enhancements to the request/response cycle. The new\n:option:`check --deploy` option allows you to check your production settings\nfile for ways to increase the security of your site.\n\n.. _django-secure: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-secure\n\nNew PostgreSQL specific functionality\n-------------------------------------\n\nDjango now has a module with extensions for PostgreSQL specific features, such\nas :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.fields.ArrayField`,\n:class:`~django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField`, :ref:`range-fields`, and\n:lookup:`unaccent` lookup. A full breakdown of the features is available\n:doc:`in the documentation </ref/contrib/postgres/index>`.\n\nNew data types\n--------------\n\n* Django now has a :class:`~django.db.models.UUIDField` for storing\n  universally unique identifiers. It is stored as the native ``uuid`` data type\n  on PostgreSQL and as a fixed length character field on other backends. There\n  is a corresponding :class:`form field <django.forms.UUIDField>`.\n\n* Django now has a :class:`~django.db.models.DurationField` for storing periods\n  of time - modeled in Python by :class:`~python:datetime.timedelta`. It is\n  stored in the native ``interval`` data type on PostgreSQL, as a ``INTERVAL\n  DAY(9) TO SECOND(6)`` on Oracle, and as a ``bigint`` of microseconds on other\n  backends. Date and time related arithmetic has also been improved on all\n  backends. There is a corresponding :class:`form field\n  <django.forms.DurationField>`.\n\nQuery Expressions, Conditional Expressions, and Database Functions\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:doc:`Query Expressions </ref/models/expressions>` allow you to create,\ncustomize, and compose complex SQL expressions. This has enabled annotate\nto accept expressions other than aggregates. Aggregates are now able to\nreference multiple fields, as well as perform arithmetic, similar to ``F()``\nobjects. :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.order_by` has also gained the\nability to accept expressions.\n\n:doc:`Conditional Expressions </ref/models/conditional-expressions>` allow\nyou to use :keyword:`if` ... :keyword:`elif` ... :keyword:`else` logic within\nqueries.\n\nA collection of :doc:`database functions </ref/models/database-functions>` is\nalso included with functionality such as\n:class:`~django.db.models.functions.Coalesce`,\n:class:`~django.db.models.functions.Concat`, and\n:class:`~django.db.models.functions.Substr`.\n\n``TestCase`` data setup\n-----------------------\n\n:class:`~django.test.TestCase` has been refactored to allow for data\ninitialization at the class level using transactions and savepoints. Database\nbackends which do not support transactions, like MySQL with the MyISAM storage\nengine, will still be able to run these tests but won't benefit from the\nimprovements. Tests are now run within two nested\n:func:`~django.db.transaction.atomic()` blocks: one for the whole class and one\nfor each test.\n\n* The class method\n  :meth:`TestCase.setUpTestData() <django.test.TestCase.setUpTestData>` adds\n  the ability to setup test data at the class level. Using this technique can\n  speed up the tests as compared to using ``setUp()``.\n\n* Fixture loading within ``TestCase`` is now performed once for the whole\n  ``TestCase``.\n\nMinor features\n--------------\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.admin`\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* :class:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin` now has a\n  :meth:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_module_permission`\n  method to allow limiting access to the module on the admin index page.\n\n* :class:`~django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin` now has an attribute\n  :attr:`~django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.show_change_link` that\n  supports showing a link to an inline object's change form.\n\n* Use the new ``django.contrib.admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter`` in\n  :attr:`ModelAdmin.list_filter <django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter>`\n  to limit the ``list_filter`` choices to foreign objects which are attached to\n  those from the ``ModelAdmin``.\n\n* The :meth:`ModelAdmin.delete_view()\n  <django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.delete_view>` displays a summary of objects\n  to be deleted on the deletion confirmation page.\n\n* The jQuery library embedded in the admin has been upgraded to version 1.11.2.\n\n* You can now specify :attr:`AdminSite.site_url\n  <django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.site_url>` in order to display a link to the\n  front-end site.\n\n* You can now specify :attr:`ModelAdmin.show_full_result_count\n  <django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.show_full_result_count>` to control whether\n  or not the full count of objects should be displayed on a filtered admin page.\n\n* The ``AdminSite.password_change()`` method now has an ``extra_context``\n  parameter.\n\n* You can now control who may login to the admin site by overriding only\n  :meth:`AdminSite.has_permission()\n  <django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.has_permission>` and\n  :attr:`AdminSite.login_form <django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.login_form>`.\n  The ``base.html`` template has a new block ``usertools`` which contains the\n  user-specific header. A new context variable ``has_permission``, which gets\n  its value from :meth:`~django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.has_permission`,\n  indicates whether the user may access the site.\n\n* Foreign key dropdowns now have buttons for changing or deleting related\n  objects using a popup.\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.admindocs`\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* reStructuredText is now parsed in model docstrings.\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.auth`\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Authorization backends can now raise\n  :class:`~django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied` in\n  :meth:`~django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_perm`\n  and :meth:`~django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_module_perms`\n  to short-circuit permission checking.\n* :class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm` now\n  has a method :meth:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm.send_email`\n  that can be overridden to customize the mail to be sent.\n\n* The ``max_length`` of :attr:`Permission.name\n  <django.contrib.auth.models.Permission.name>` has been increased from 50 to\n  255 characters. Please run the database migration.\n\n* :attr:`~django.contrib.auth.models.CustomUser.USERNAME_FIELD` and\n  :attr:`~django.contrib.auth.models.CustomUser.REQUIRED_FIELDS` now supports\n  :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey`\\s.\n\n* The default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher has been\n  increased by 33%. This backwards compatible change will not affect users who\n  have subclassed ``django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher`` to\n  change the default value.\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.gis`\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* A new :doc:`GeoJSON serializer </ref/contrib/gis/serializers>` is now\n  available.\n\n* It is now allowed to include a subquery as a geographic lookup argument, for\n  example ``City.objects.filter(point__within=Country.objects.filter(continent='Africa').values('mpoly'))``.\n\n* The SpatiaLite backend now supports ``Collect`` and ``Extent`` aggregates\n  when the database version is 3.0 or later.\n\n* The PostGIS 2 ``CREATE EXTENSION postgis`` and the SpatiaLite\n  ``SELECT InitSpatialMetaData`` initialization commands are now automatically\n  run by :djadmin:`migrate`.\n\n* The GDAL interface now supports retrieving properties of\n  :ref:`raster (image) data file <raster-data-source-objects>`.\n\n* Compatibility shims for ``SpatialRefSys`` and ``GeometryColumns`` changed in\n  Django 1.2 have been removed.\n\n* All GDAL-related exceptions are now raised with ``GDALException``. The former\n  ``OGRException`` has been kept for backwards compatibility but should not be\n  used any longer.\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.sessions`\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Session cookie is now deleted after\n  :meth:`~django.contrib.sessions.backends.base.SessionBase.flush()` is called.\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.sitemaps`\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* The new :attr:`Sitemap.i18n <django.contrib.sitemaps.Sitemap.i18n>` attribute\n  allows you to generate a sitemap based on the :setting:`LANGUAGES` setting.\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.sites`\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* :func:`~django.contrib.sites.shortcuts.get_current_site` will now lookup\n  the current site based on :meth:`request.get_host()\n  <django.http.HttpRequest.get_host>` if the :setting:`SITE_ID` setting is not\n  defined.\n\n* The default :class:`~django.contrib.sites.models.Site` created when running\n  ``migrate`` now respects the :setting:`SITE_ID` setting (instead of always\n  using ``pk=1``).\n\nCache\n~~~~~\n\n* The ``incr()`` method of the\n  ``django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache`` backend is now thread-safe.\n\nCryptography\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* The ``max_age`` parameter of the\n  :meth:`django.core.signing.TimestampSigner.unsign` method now also accepts a\n  :py:class:`datetime.timedelta` object.\n\nDatabase backends\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* The MySQL backend no longer strips microseconds from ``datetime`` values as\n  MySQL 5.6.4 and up supports fractional seconds depending on the declaration\n  of the datetime field (when ``DATETIME`` includes fractional precision greater\n  than 0). New datetime database columns created with Django 1.8 and MySQL 5.6.4\n  and up will support microseconds. See the :ref:`MySQL database notes\n  <mysql-fractional-seconds>` for more details.\n\n* The MySQL backend no longer creates explicit indexes for foreign keys when\n  using the InnoDB storage engine, as MySQL already creates them automatically.\n\n* The Oracle backend no longer defines the ``connection_persists_old_columns``\n  feature as ``True``. Instead, Oracle will now include a cache busting clause\n  when getting the description of a table.\n\nEmail\n~~~~~\n\n* :ref:`Email backends <topic-email-backends>` now support the context manager\n  protocol for opening and closing connections.\n\n* The SMTP email backend now supports ``keyfile`` and ``certfile``\n  authentication with the :setting:`EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE` and\n  :setting:`EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE` settings.\n\n* The SMTP :class:`~django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend` now supports\n  setting the ``timeout`` parameter with the :setting:`EMAIL_TIMEOUT` setting.\n\n* :class:`~django.core.mail.EmailMessage` and ``EmailMultiAlternatives`` now\n  support the ``reply_to`` parameter.\n\nFile Storage\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* :meth:`Storage.get_available_name()\n  <django.core.files.storage.Storage.get_available_name>` and\n  :meth:`Storage.save() <django.core.files.storage.Storage.save>`\n  now take a ``max_length`` argument to implement storage-level maximum\n  filename length constraints. Filenames exceeding this argument will get\n  truncated. This prevents a database error when appending a unique suffix to a\n  long filename that already exists on the storage. See the :ref:`deprecation\n  note <storage-max-length-update>` about adding this argument to your custom\n  storage classes.\n\nForms\n~~~~~\n\n* Form widgets now render attributes with a value of ``True`` or ``False``\n  as HTML5 boolean attributes.\n\n* The new :meth:`~django.forms.Form.has_error()` method allows checking\n  if a specific error has happened.\n\n* If :attr:`~django.forms.Form.required_css_class` is defined on a form, then\n  the ``<label>`` tags for required fields will have this class present in its\n  attributes.\n\n* The rendering of non-field errors in unordered lists (``<ul>``) now includes\n  ``nonfield`` in its list of classes to distinguish them from field-specific\n  errors.\n\n* :class:`~django.forms.Field` now accepts a\n  :attr:`~django.forms.Field.label_suffix` argument, which will override the\n  form's :attr:`~django.forms.Form.label_suffix`. This enables customizing the\n  suffix on a per-field basis \u2014 previously it wasn't possible to override\n  a form's :attr:`~django.forms.Form.label_suffix` while using  shortcuts such\n  as ``{{ form.as_p }}`` in templates.\n\n* :class:`~django.forms.SelectDateWidget` now accepts an\n  :attr:`~django.forms.SelectDateWidget.empty_label` argument, which will\n  override the top list choice label when :class:`~django.forms.DateField`\n  is not required.\n\n* After an :class:`~django.forms.ImageField` has been cleaned and validated, the\n  ``UploadedFile`` object will have an additional ``image`` attribute containing\n  the Pillow ``Image`` instance used to check if the file was a valid image. It\n  will also update ``UploadedFile.content_type`` with the image's content type\n  as determined by Pillow.\n\n* You can now pass a callable that returns an iterable of choices when\n  instantiating a :class:`~django.forms.ChoiceField`.\n\nGeneric Views\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Generic views that use :class:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin`\n  may now specify the ordering applied to the\n  :attr:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.queryset` by setting\n  :attr:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.ordering` or overriding\n  :meth:`~django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.get_ordering()`.\n\n* The new :attr:`SingleObjectMixin.query_pk_and_slug\n  <django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin.query_pk_and_slug>`\n  attribute allows changing the behavior of\n  :meth:`~django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin.get_object()`\n  so that it'll perform its lookup using both the primary key and the slug.\n\n* The :meth:`~django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin.get_form()` method doesn't\n  require a ``form_class`` to be provided anymore. If not provided ``form_class``\n  defaults to :meth:`~django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin.get_form_class()`.\n\n* Placeholders in :attr:`ModelFormMixin.success_url\n  <django.views.generic.edit.ModelFormMixin.success_url>` now support the Python\n  :py:meth:`str.format()` syntax. The legacy ``%(<foo>)s`` syntax is still\n  supported but will be removed in Django 1.10.\n\nInternationalization\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* :setting:`FORMAT_MODULE_PATH` can now be a list of strings representing\n  module paths. This allows importing several format modules from different\n  reusable apps. It also allows overriding those custom formats in your main\n  Django project.\n\nLogging\n~~~~~~~\n\n* The :class:`django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler` class now has a\n  :meth:`~django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler.send_mail` method to make it more\n  subclass friendly.\n\nManagement Commands\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Database connections are now always closed after a management command called\n  from the command line has finished doing its job.\n\n* Commands from alternate package formats like eggs are now also discovered.\n\n* The new :option:`dumpdata --output` option allows specifying a file to which\n  the serialized data is written.\n\n* The new :option:`makemessages --exclude` and :option:`compilemessages\n  --exclude` options allow excluding specific locales from processing.\n\n* :djadmin:`compilemessages` now has a ``--use-fuzzy`` or ``-f`` option which\n  includes fuzzy translations into compiled files.\n\n* The :option:`loaddata --ignorenonexistent` option now ignores data for models\n  that no longer exist.\n\n* :djadmin:`runserver` now uses daemon threads for faster reloading.\n\n* :djadmin:`inspectdb` now outputs ``Meta.unique_together``. It is also able to\n  introspect :class:`~django.db.models.AutoField` for MySQL and PostgreSQL\n  databases.\n\n* When calling management commands with options using\n  :func:`~django.core.management.call_command`, the option name can match the\n  command line option name (without the initial dashes) or the final option\n  destination variable name, but in either case, the resulting option received\n  by the command is now always the ``dest`` name specified in the command\n  option definition (as long as the command uses the :mod:`argparse` module).\n\n* The :djadmin:`dbshell` command now supports MySQL's optional SSL certificate\n  authority setting (``--ssl-ca``).\n\n* The new :option:`makemigrations --name` allows giving the migration(s) a\n  custom name instead of a generated one.\n\n* The :djadmin:`loaddata` command now prevents repeated fixture loading. If\n  :setting:`FIXTURE_DIRS` contains duplicates or a default fixture directory\n  path (``app_name/fixtures``), an exception is raised.\n\n* The new :option:`makemigrations --exit` option allows exiting with an error\n  code if no migrations are created.\n\n* The new :djadmin:`showmigrations` command allows listing all migrations and\n  their dependencies in a project.\n\nMiddleware\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* The :attr:`CommonMiddleware.response_redirect_class\n  <django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware.response_redirect_class>`\n  attribute allows you to customize the redirects issued by the middleware.\n\n* A debug message will be logged to the ``django.request`` logger when a\n  middleware raises a :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.MiddlewareNotUsed` exception\n  in :setting:`DEBUG` mode.\n\nMigrations\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* The :class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL` operation can now handle\n  parameters passed to the SQL statements.\n\n* It is now possible to have migrations (most probably :ref:`data migrations\n  <data-migrations>`) for applications without models.\n\n* Migrations can now :ref:`serialize model managers\n  <using-managers-in-migrations>` as part of the model state.\n\n* A :ref:`generic mechanism to handle the deprecation of model fields\n  <migrations-removing-model-fields>` was added.\n\n* The :meth:`RunPython.noop() <django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython.noop>`\n  and :attr:`RunSQL.noop <django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL.noop>` class\n  method/attribute were added to ease in making ``RunPython`` and ``RunSQL``\n  operations reversible.\n\n* The migration operations :class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython`\n  and :class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL` now call the\n  :meth:`allow_migrate` method of database routers. The router can use the\n  newly introduced ``app_label`` and ``hints`` arguments to make a routing\n  decision. To take advantage of this feature you need to update the router to\n  the new ``allow_migrate`` signature, see the :ref:`deprecation section\n  <deprecated-signature-of-allow-migrate>` for more details.\n\nModels\n~~~~~~\n\n* Django now logs at most 9000 queries in ``connections.queries``, in order\n  to prevent excessive memory usage in long-running processes in debug mode.\n\n* There is now a model ``Meta`` option to define a\n  :attr:`default related name <django.db.models.Options.default_related_name>`\n  for all relational fields of a model.\n\n* Pickling models and querysets across different versions of Django isn't\n  officially supported (it may work, but there's no guarantee). An extra\n  variable that specifies the current Django version is now added to the\n  pickled state of models and querysets, and Django raises a ``RuntimeWarning``\n  when these objects are unpickled in a different version than the one in\n  which they were pickled.\n\n* Added :meth:`Model.from_db() <django.db.models.Model.from_db()>` which\n  Django uses whenever objects are loaded using the ORM. The method allows\n  customizing model loading behavior.\n\n* ``extra(select={...})`` now allows you to escape a literal ``%s`` sequence\n  using ``%%s``.\n\n* :doc:`Custom Lookups</howto/custom-lookups>` can now be registered using\n  a decorator pattern.\n\n* The new :attr:`Transform.bilateral <django.db.models.Transform.bilateral>`\n  attribute allows creating bilateral transformations. These transformations\n  are applied to both ``lhs`` and ``rhs`` when used in a lookup expression,\n  providing opportunities for more sophisticated lookups.\n\n* SQL special characters (\\, %, _) are now escaped properly when a pattern\n  lookup (e.g. ``contains``, ``startswith``, etc.) is used with an ``F()``\n  expression as the right-hand side. In those cases, the escaping is performed\n  by the database, which can lead to somewhat complex queries involving nested\n  ``REPLACE`` function calls.\n\n* You can now refresh model instances by using :meth:`Model.refresh_from_db()\n  <django.db.models.Model.refresh_from_db>`.\n\n* You can now get the set of deferred fields for a model using\n  :meth:`Model.get_deferred_fields() <django.db.models.Model.get_deferred_fields>`.\n\n* Model field ``default``\u2019s are now used when primary key field's are set to\n  ``None``.\n\nSignals\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Exceptions from the ``(receiver, exception)`` tuples returned by\n  :meth:`Signal.send_robust() <django.dispatch.Signal.send_robust>` now have\n  their traceback attached as a ``__traceback__`` attribute.\n\n* The ``environ`` argument, which contains the WSGI environment structure from\n  the request, was added to the :data:`~django.core.signals.request_started`\n  signal.\n\n* You can now import the :func:`~django.test.signals.setting_changed` signal\n  from ``django.core.signals`` to avoid loading ``django.test`` in non-test\n  situations. Django no longer does so itself.\n\nSystem Check Framework\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* :attr:`~django.core.checks.register` can now be used as a function.\n\nTemplates\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n* :tfilter:`urlize` now supports domain-only links that include characters after\n  the top-level domain (e.g. ``djangoproject.com/`` and\n  ``djangoproject.com/download/``).\n\n* :tfilter:`urlize` doesn't treat exclamation marks at the end of a domain or\n  its query string as part of the URL (the URL in e.g. ``'djangoproject.com!``\n  is ``djangoproject.com``)\n\n* Added a :class:`locmem.Loader <django.template.loaders.locmem.Loader>`\n  class that loads Django templates from a Python dictionary.\n\n* The :ttag:`now` tag can now store its output in a context variable with the\n  usual syntax: ``{% now 'j n Y' as varname %}``.\n\nRequests and Responses\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* ``WSGIRequest`` now respects paths starting with ``//``.\n\n* The :meth:`HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri()\n  <django.http.HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri>` method now handles paths\n  starting with ``//`` correctly.\n\n* If :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True`` and a request raises a\n  :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation`, the response will be\n  rendered with a detailed error page.\n\n* The ``query_string`` argument of :class:`~django.http.QueryDict` is now\n  optional, defaulting to ``None``, so a blank ``QueryDict`` can now be\n  instantiated with ``QueryDict()`` instead of ``QueryDict(None)`` or\n  ``QueryDict('')``.\n\n* The ``GET`` and ``POST`` attributes of an :class:`~django.http.HttpRequest`\n  object are now :class:`~django.http.QueryDict`\\s rather than dictionaries,\n  and the ``FILES`` attribute is now a ``MultiValueDict``.\n  This brings this class into line with the documentation and with\n  ``WSGIRequest``.\n\n* The :attr:`HttpResponse.charset <django.http.HttpResponse.charset>` attribute\n  was added.\n\n* ``WSGIRequestHandler`` now follows RFC in converting URI to IRI, using\n  ``uri_to_iri()``.\n\n* The :meth:`HttpRequest.get_full_path()\n  <django.http.HttpRequest.get_full_path>` method now escapes unsafe characters\n  from the path portion of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) properly.\n\n* :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse` now implements a few additional methods\n  like :meth:`~django.http.HttpResponse.getvalue` so that instances can be used\n  as stream objects.\n\n* The new :meth:`HttpResponse.setdefault()\n  <django.http.HttpResponse.setdefault>` method allows setting a header unless\n  it has already been set.\n\n* You can use the new :class:`~django.http.FileResponse` to stream files.\n\n* The :func:`~django.views.decorators.http.condition` decorator for\n  conditional view processing now supports the ``If-unmodified-since`` header.\n\nTests\n~~~~~\n\n* The :class:`RequestFactory.trace() <django.test.RequestFactory>`\n  and :class:`Client.trace() <django.test.Client.trace>` methods were\n  implemented, allowing you to create ``TRACE`` requests in your tests.\n\n* The ``count`` argument was added to\n  :meth:`~django.test.SimpleTestCase.assertTemplateUsed`. This allows you to\n  assert that a template was rendered a specific number of times.\n\n* The new :meth:`~django.test.SimpleTestCase.assertJSONNotEqual` assertion\n  allows you to test that two JSON fragments are not equal.\n\n* Added options to the :djadmin:`test` command to preserve the test database\n  (:option:`--keepdb <test --keepdb>`), to run the test cases in reverse order\n  (:option:`--reverse <test --reverse>`), and to enable SQL logging for failing\n  tests (:option:`--debug-sql <test --debug-sql>`).\n\n* Added the :attr:`~django.test.Response.resolver_match` attribute to test\n  client responses.\n\n* Added several settings that allow customization of test tablespace parameters\n  for Oracle: :setting:`DATAFILE`, :setting:`DATAFILE_TMP`,\n  :setting:`DATAFILE_MAXSIZE` and :setting:`DATAFILE_TMP_MAXSIZE`.\n\n* The :func:`~django.test.override_settings` decorator can now affect the\n  master router in :setting:`DATABASE_ROUTERS`.\n\n* Added test client support for file uploads with file-like objects.\n\n* A shared cache is now used when testing with an SQLite in-memory database when\n  using Python 3.4+ and SQLite 3.7.13+. This allows sharing the database\n  between threads.\n\nValidators\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* :class:`~django.core.validators.URLValidator` now supports IPv6 addresses,\n  unicode domains, and URLs containing authentication data.\n\n.. _backwards-incompatible-1.8:\n\nBackwards incompatible changes in 1.8\n=====================================\n\n.. warning::\n\n    In addition to the changes outlined in this section, be sure to review the\n    :ref:`deprecation plan <deprecation-removed-in-1.8>` for any features that\n    have been removed. If you haven't updated your code within the\n    deprecation timeline for a given feature, its removal may appear as a\n    backwards incompatible change.\n\nRelated object operations are run in a transaction\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSome operations on related objects such as\n:meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.add()` or direct\nassignment ran multiple data modifying queries without wrapping them in\ntransactions. To reduce the risk of data corruption, all data modifying methods\nthat affect multiple related objects (i.e. ``add()``, ``remove()``,\n``clear()``, and direct assignment) now perform their data modifying queries\nfrom within a transaction, provided your database supports transactions.\n\nThis has one backwards incompatible side effect, signal handlers triggered from\nthese methods are now executed within the method's transaction and any\nexception in a signal handler will prevent the whole operation.\n\n.. _unsaved-model-instance-check-18:\n\nAssigning unsaved objects to relations raises an error\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n.. note::\n\n    To more easily allow in-memory usage of models, this change was reverted in\n    Django 1.8.4 and replaced with a check during ``model.save()``. For example::\n\n        >>> book = Book.objects.create(name=\"Django\")\n        >>> book.author = Author(name=\"John\")\n        >>> book.save()\n        Traceback (most recent call last):\n        ...\n        ValueError: save() prohibited to prevent data loss due to unsaved related object 'author'.\n\n    A similar check on assignment to reverse one-to-one relations was removed\n    in Django 1.8.5.\n\nAssigning unsaved objects to a :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey`,\n:class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey`, and\n:class:`~django.db.models.OneToOneField` now raises a :exc:`ValueError`.\n\nPreviously, the assignment of an unsaved object would be silently ignored.\nFor example::\n\n    >>> book = Book.objects.create(name=\"Django\")\n    >>> book.author = Author(name=\"John\")\n    >>> book.author.save()\n    >>> book.save()\n\n    >>> Book.objects.get(name=\"Django\")\n    >>> book.author\n    >>>\n\nNow, an error will be raised to prevent data loss::\n\n    >>> book.author = Author(name=\"john\")\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    ValueError: Cannot assign \"<Author: John>\": \"Author\" instance isn't saved in the database.\n\nIf you require allowing the assignment of unsaved instances (the old behavior)\nand aren't concerned about the data loss possibility (e.g. you never save the\nobjects to the database), you can disable this check by using the\n``ForeignKey.allow_unsaved_instance_assignment`` attribute. (This attribute was\nremoved in 1.8.4 as it's no longer relevant.)\n\nManagement commands that only accept positional arguments\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have written a custom management command that only accepts positional\narguments and you didn't specify the ``args`` command variable, you might get\nan error like ``Error: unrecognized arguments: ...``, as variable parsing is\nnow based on :py:mod:`argparse` which doesn't implicitly accept positional\narguments. You can make your command backwards compatible by simply setting the\n``args`` class variable. However, if you don't have to keep compatibility with\nolder Django versions, it's better to implement the new\n:meth:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand.add_arguments` method as described\nin :doc:`/howto/custom-management-commands`.\n\nCustom test management command arguments through test runner\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe method to add custom arguments to the `test` management command through the\ntest runner has changed. Previously, you could provide an `option_list` class\nvariable on the test runner to add more arguments (\u00e0 la :py:mod:`optparse`).\nNow to implement the same behavior, you have to create an\n``add_arguments(cls, parser)`` class method on the test runner and call\n``parser.add_argument`` to add any custom arguments, as parser is now an\n:py:class:`argparse.ArgumentParser` instance.\n\nModel check ensures auto-generated column names are within limits specified by database\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA field name that's longer than the column name length supported by a database\ncan create problems. For example, with MySQL you'll get an exception trying to\ncreate the column, and with PostgreSQL the column name is truncated by the\ndatabase (you may see a warning in the PostgreSQL logs).\n\nA model check has been introduced to better alert users to this scenario before\nthe actual creation of database tables.\n\nIf you have an existing model where this check seems to be a false positive,\nfor example on PostgreSQL where the name was already being truncated, simply\nuse :attr:`~django.db.models.Field.db_column` to specify the name that's being\nused.\n\nThe check also applies to the columns generated in an implicit\n``ManyToManyField.through`` model. If you run into an issue there, use\n:attr:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through` to create an explicit model\nand then specify :attr:`~django.db.models.Field.db_column` on its column(s)\nas needed.\n\nQuery relation lookups now check object types\n---------------------------------------------\n\nQuerying for model lookups now checks if the object passed is of correct type\nand raises a :exc:`ValueError` if not. Previously, Django didn't care if the\nobject was of correct type; it just used the object's related field attribute\n(e.g. ``id``) for the lookup. Now, an error is raised to prevent incorrect\nlookups::\n\n    >>> book = Book.objects.create(name=\"Django\")\n    >>> book = Book.objects.filter(author=book)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    ValueError: Cannot query \"<Book: Django>\": Must be \"Author\" instance.\n\n``select_related()`` now checks given fields\n--------------------------------------------\n\n``select_related()`` now validates that the given fields actually exist.\nPreviously, nonexistent fields were silently ignored. Now, an error is raised::\n\n    >>> book = Book.objects.select_related('nonexistent_field')\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    FieldError: Invalid field name(s) given in select_related: 'nonexistent_field'\n\nThe validation also makes sure that the given field is relational::\n\n    >>> book = Book.objects.select_related('name')\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    FieldError: Non-relational field given in select_related: 'name'\n\nDefault ``EmailField.max_length`` increased to 254\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe old default 75 character ``max_length`` was not capable of storing all\npossible RFC3696/5321-compliant email addresses. In order to store all\npossible valid email addresses, the ``max_length`` has been increased to 254\ncharacters. You will need to generate and apply database migrations for your\naffected models (or add ``max_length=75`` if you wish to keep the length on\nyour current fields). A migration for\n:attr:`django.contrib.auth.models.User.email` is included.\n\nSupport for PostgreSQL versions older than 9.0\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe end of upstream support periods was reached in July 2014 for PostgreSQL 8.4.\nAs a consequence, Django 1.8 sets 9.0 as the minimum PostgreSQL version it\nofficially supports.\n\nThis also includes dropping support for PostGIS 1.3 and 1.4 as these versions\nare not supported on versions of PostgreSQL later than 8.4.\n\nDjango also now requires the use of Psycopg2 version 2.4.5 or higher (or 2.5+\nif you want to use :mod:`django.contrib.postgres`).\n\nSupport for MySQL versions older than 5.5\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe end of upstream support periods was reached in January 2012 for MySQL 5.0\nand December 2013 for MySQL 5.1. As a consequence, Django 1.8 sets 5.5 as the\nminimum MySQL version it officially supports.\n\nSupport for Oracle versions older than 11.1\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe end of upstream support periods was reached in July 2010 for Oracle 9.2,\nJanuary 2012 for Oracle 10.1, and July 2013 for Oracle 10.2. As a consequence,\nDjango 1.8 sets 11.1 as the minimum Oracle version it officially supports.\n\nSpecific privileges used instead of roles for tests on Oracle\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarlier versions of Django granted the CONNECT and RESOURCE roles to the test\nuser on Oracle. These roles have been deprecated, so Django 1.8 uses the\nspecific underlying privileges instead. This changes the privileges required\nof the main user for running tests (unless the project is configured to avoid\ncreating a test user). The exact privileges required now are detailed in\n:ref:`Oracle notes <oracle-notes>`.\n\n``AbstractUser.last_login`` allows null values\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe :attr:`AbstractUser.last_login <django.contrib.auth.models.User.last_login>`\nfield now allows null values. Previously, it defaulted to the time when the user\nwas created which was misleading if the user never logged in. If you are using\nthe default user (:class:`django.contrib.auth.models.User`), run the database\nmigration included in ``contrib.auth``.\n\nIf you are using a custom user model that inherits from ``AbstractUser``,\nyou'll need to run :djadmin:`makemigrations` and generate a migration for your\napp that contains that model. Also, if wish to set ``last_login`` to ``NULL``\nfor users who haven't logged in, you can run this query::\n\n    from django.db import models\n    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\n    from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser\n\n    UserModel = get_user_model()\n    if issubclass(UserModel, AbstractBaseUser):\n        UserModel._default_manager.filter(\n            last_login=models.F('date_joined')\n        ).update(last_login=None)\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.gis`\n-------------------------\n\n* Support for GEOS 3.1 and GDAL 1.6 has been dropped.\n\n* Support for SpatiaLite < 2.4 has been dropped.\n\n* GIS-specific lookups have been refactored to use the\n  :class:`django.db.models.Lookup` API.\n\n* The default ``str`` representation of\n  :class:`~django.contrib.gis.geos.GEOSGeometry` objects has been changed from\n  WKT to EWKT format (including the SRID). As this representation is used in\n  the serialization framework, that means that ``dumpdata`` output will now\n  contain the SRID value of geometry objects.\n\nPriority of context processors for ``TemplateResponse`` brought in line with ``render``\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe :class:`~django.template.response.TemplateResponse` constructor is designed to be a\ndrop-in replacement for the :func:`~django.shortcuts.render` function. However,\nit had a slight incompatibility, in that for ``TemplateResponse``, context data\nfrom the passed in context dictionary could be shadowed by context data returned\nfrom context processors, whereas for ``render`` it was the other way\naround. This was a bug, and the behavior of ``render`` is more appropriate,\nsince it allows the globally defined context processors to be overridden locally\nin the view. If you were relying on the fact context data in a\n``TemplateResponse`` could be overridden using a context processor, you will\nneed to change your code.\n\nOverriding ``setUpClass`` / ``tearDownClass`` in test cases\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe decorators :func:`~django.test.override_settings` and\n:func:`~django.test.modify_settings` now act at the class level when used as\nclass decorators. As a consequence, when overriding ``setUpClass()`` or\n``tearDownClass()``, the ``super`` implementation should always be called.\n\nRemoval of ``django.contrib.formtools``\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe formtools contrib app has been moved to a separate package and the\nrelevant documentation pages have been updated or removed.\n\nThe new package is available `on GitHub`_ and on PyPI.\n\n.. _on GitHub: https://github.com/django/django-formtools/\n\nDatabase connection reloading between tests\n-------------------------------------------\n\nDjango previously closed database connections between each test within a\n``TestCase``. This is no longer the case as Django now wraps the whole\n``TestCase`` within a transaction. If some of your tests relied on the old\nbehavior, you should have them inherit from ``TransactionTestCase`` instead.\n\nCleanup of the ``django.template`` namespace\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you've been relying on private APIs exposed in the ``django.template``\nmodule, you may have to import them from ``django.template.base`` instead.\n\nAlso private APIs ``django.template.base.compile_string()``,\n``django.template.loader.find_template()``, and\n``django.template.loader.get_template_from_string()`` were removed.\n\n``model`` attribute on private model relations\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIn earlier versions of Django, on a model with a reverse foreign key\nrelationship (for example), ``model._meta.get_all_related_objects()`` returned\nthe relationship as a ``django.db.models.related.RelatedObject`` with the\n``model`` attribute set to the source of the relationship. Now, this method\nreturns the relationship as ``django.db.models.fields.related.ManyToOneRel``\n(private API ``RelatedObject`` has been removed), and the ``model`` attribute\nis set to the target of the relationship instead of the source. The source\nmodel is accessible on the ``related_model`` attribute instead.\n\nConsider this example from the tutorial in Django 1.8::\n\n    >>> p = Poll.objects.get(pk=1)\n    >>> p._meta.get_all_related_objects()\n    [<ManyToOneRel: polls.choice>]\n    >>> p._meta.get_all_related_objects()[0].model\n    <class 'polls.models.Poll'>\n    >>> p._meta.get_all_related_objects()[0].related_model\n    <class 'polls.models.Choice'>\n\nand compare it to the behavior on older versions::\n\n    >>> p._meta.get_all_related_objects()\n    [<RelatedObject: polls:choice related to poll>]\n    >>> p._meta.get_all_related_objects()[0].model\n    <class 'polls.models.Choice'>\n\nTo access the source model, you can use a pattern like this to write code that\nwill work with both Django 1.8 and older versions::\n\n    for relation in opts.get_all_related_objects():\n        to_model = getattr(relation, 'related_model', relation.model)\n\nAlso note that ``get_all_related_objects()`` is deprecated in 1.8. See the\n:ref:`upgrade guide <migrating-old-meta-api>` for the new API.\n\nDatabase backend API\n--------------------\n\nThe following changes to the database backend API are documented to assist\nthose writing third-party backends in updating their code:\n\n* ``BaseDatabaseXXX`` classes have been moved to ``django.db.backends.base``.\n  Please import them from the new locations::\n\n    from django.db.backends.base.base import BaseDatabaseWrapper\n    from django.db.backends.base.client import BaseDatabaseClient\n    from django.db.backends.base.creation import BaseDatabaseCreation\n    from django.db.backends.base.features import BaseDatabaseFeatures\n    from django.db.backends.base.introspection import BaseDatabaseIntrospection\n    from django.db.backends.base.introspection import FieldInfo, TableInfo\n    from django.db.backends.base.operations import BaseDatabaseOperations\n    from django.db.backends.base.schema import BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\n    from django.db.backends.base.validation import BaseDatabaseValidation\n\n* The ``data_types``, ``data_types_suffix``, and\n  ``data_type_check_constraints`` attributes have moved from the\n  ``DatabaseCreation`` class to ``DatabaseWrapper``.\n\n* The ``SQLCompiler.as_sql()`` method now takes a ``subquery`` parameter\n  (:ticket:`24164`).\n\n* The ``BaseDatabaseOperations.date_interval_sql()`` method now only takes a\n  ``timedelta`` parameter.\n\n:mod:`django.contrib.admin`\n---------------------------\n\n* ``AdminSite`` no longer takes an ``app_name`` argument and its ``app_name``\n  attribute has been removed. The application name is always ``admin`` (as\n  opposed to the instance name which you can still customize using\n  ``AdminSite(name=\"...\")``.\n\n* The ``ModelAdmin.get_object()`` method (private API) now takes a third\n  argument named ``from_field`` in order to specify which field should match\n  the provided ``object_id``.\n\n* The :meth:`ModelAdmin.response_delete()\n  <django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.response_delete>` method\n  now takes a second argument named ``obj_id`` which is the serialized\n  identifier used to retrieve the object before deletion.\n\nDefault autoescaping of functions in ``django.template.defaultfilters``\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to make built-in template filters that output HTML \"safe by default\"\nwhen calling them in Python code, the following functions in\n``django.template.defaultfilters`` have been changed to automatically escape\ntheir input value:\n\n* ``join``\n* ``linebreaksbr``\n* ``linebreaks_filter``\n* ``linenumbers``\n* ``unordered_list``\n* ``urlize``\n* ``urlizetrunc``\n\nYou can revert to the old behavior by specifying ``autoescape=False`` if you\nare passing trusted content. This change doesn't have any effect when using\nthe corresponding filters in templates.\n\nMiscellaneous\n-------------\n\n* ``connections.queries`` is now a read-only attribute.\n\n* Database connections are considered equal only if they're the same object.\n  They aren't hashable any more.\n\n* :class:`~django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware` used to disable compression\n  for some content types when the request is from Internet Explorer, in order\n  to work around a bug in IE6 and earlier. This behavior could affect\n  performance on IE7 and later. It was removed.\n\n* ``URLField.to_python`` no longer adds a trailing slash to pathless URLs.\n\n* The :tfilter:`length` template filter now returns ``0`` for an undefined\n  variable, rather than an empty string.\n\n* ``ForeignKey.default_error_message['invalid']`` has been changed from\n  ``'%(model)s instance with pk %(pk)r does not exist.'`` to\n  ``'%(model)s instance with %(field)s %(value)r does not exist.'`` If you are\n  using this message in your own code, please update the list of interpolated\n  parameters. Internally, Django will continue to provide the\n  ``pk`` parameter in ``params`` for backwards compatibility.\n\n* ``UserCreationForm.error_messages['duplicate_username']`` is no longer used.\n  If you wish to customize that error message, :ref:`override it on the form\n  <modelforms-overriding-default-fields>` using the ``'unique'`` key in\n  ``Meta.error_messages['username']`` or, if you have a custom form field for\n  ``'username'``, using the the ``'unique'`` key in its\n  :attr:`~django.forms.Field.error_messages` argument.\n\n* The block ``usertools`` in the ``base.html`` template of\n  :mod:`django.contrib.admin` now requires the ``has_permission`` context\n  variable to be set. If you have any custom admin views that use this\n  template, update them to pass :meth:`AdminSite.has_permission()\n  <django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.has_permission>` as this new variable's\n  value or simply include :meth:`AdminSite.each_context(request)\n  <django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.each_context>` in the context.\n\n* Internal changes were made to the :class:`~django.forms.ClearableFileInput`\n  widget to allow more customization. The undocumented ``url_markup_template``\n  attribute was removed in favor of ``template_with_initial``.\n\n* For consistency with other major vendors, the ``en_GB`` locale now has Monday\n  as the first day of the week.\n\n* Seconds have been removed from any locales that had them in ``TIME_FORMAT``,\n  ``DATETIME_FORMAT``, or ``SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT``.\n\n* The default max size of the Oracle test tablespace has increased from 300M\n  (or 200M, before 1.7.2) to 500M.\n\n* ``reverse()`` and ``reverse_lazy()`` now return Unicode strings instead of\n  byte strings.\n\n* The ``CacheClass`` shim has been removed from all cache backends.\n  These aliases were provided for backwards compatibility with Django 1.3.\n  If you are still using them, please update your project to use the real\n  class name found in the :setting:`BACKEND <CACHES-BACKEND>` key of the\n  :setting:`CACHES` setting.\n\n* By default, :func:`~django.core.management.call_command` now always skips the\n  check framework (unless you pass it ``skip_checks=False``).\n\n* When iterating over lines, :class:`~django.core.files.File` now uses\n  `universal newlines`_. The following are recognized as ending a line: the\n  Unix end-of-line convention ``'\\n'``, the Windows convention ``'\\r\\n'``, and\n  the old Macintosh convention ``'\\r'``.\n\n  .. _universal newlines: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0278\n\n* The Memcached cache backends ``MemcachedCache`` and ``PyLibMCCache`` will\n  delete a key if ``set()`` fails. This is necessary to ensure the ``cache_db``\n  session store always fetches the most current session data.\n\n* Private APIs ``override_template_loaders`` and ``override_with_test_loader``\n  in ``django.test.utils`` were removed. Override ``TEMPLATES`` with\n  ``override_settings`` instead.\n\n* Warnings from the MySQL database backend are no longer converted to\n  exceptions when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True``.\n\n* :class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` now has a simplified ``repr`` (e.g.\n  ``<WSGIRequest: GET '/somepath/'>``). This won't change the behavior of\n  the :class:`~django.views.debug.SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class.\n\n* Class-based views that use :class:`~django.views.generic.edit.ModelFormMixin`\n  will raise an :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` exception\n  when both the ``fields`` and ``form_class`` attributes are specified.\n  Previously, ``fields`` was silently ignored.\n\n* When following redirects, the test client now raises\n  :exc:`~django.test.client.RedirectCycleError` if it detects a loop or hits a\n  maximum redirect limit (rather than passing silently).\n\n* Translatable strings set as the ``default`` parameter of the field are cast\n  to concrete strings later, so the return type of ``Field.get_default()`` is\n  different in some cases. There is no change to default values which are the\n  result of a callable.\n\n* ``GenericIPAddressField.empty_strings_allowed`` is now ``False``. Database\n  backends that interpret empty strings as null (only Oracle among the backends\n  that Django includes) will no longer convert null values back to an empty\n  string. This is consistent with other backends.\n\n* When the :attr:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand.leave_locale_alone`\n  attribute is ``False``, translations are now deactivated instead of forcing\n  the \"en-us\" locale. In the case your models contained non-English strings and\n  you counted on English translations to be activated in management commands,\n  this will not happen any longer. It might be that new database migrations are\n  generated (once) after migrating to 1.8.\n\n* :func:`django.utils.translation.get_language()` now returns ``None`` instead\n  of :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE` when translations are temporarily deactivated.\n\n* When a translation doesn't exist for a specific literal, the fallback is now\n  taken from the :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE` language (instead of from the\n  untranslated ``msgid`` message).\n\n* The ``name`` field of :class:`django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType`\n  has been removed by a migration and replaced by a property. That means it's\n  not possible to query or filter a ``ContentType`` by this field any longer.\n\n  Be careful if you upgrade to Django 1.8 and skip Django 1.7. If you run\n  ``manage.py migrate --fake``, this migration will be skipped and you'll see\n  a ``RuntimeError: Error creating new content types.`` exception because the\n  ``name`` column won't be dropped from the database. Use ``manage.py migrate\n  --fake-initial`` to fake only the initial migration instead.\n\n* The new :option:`migrate --fake-initial` option allows faking initial\n  migrations. In 1.7, initial migrations were always automatically faked if all\n  tables created in an initial migration already existed.\n\n* An app *without* migrations with a ``ForeignKey`` to an app *with* migrations\n  may now result in a foreign key constraint error when migrating the database\n  or running tests. In Django 1.7, this could fail silently and result in a\n  missing constraint. To resolve the error, add migrations to the app without\n  them.\n\n.. _deprecated-features-1.8:\n\nFeatures deprecated in 1.8\n==========================\n\nSelected methods in ``django.db.models.options.Options``\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs part of the formalization of the ``Model._meta`` API (from the\n:class:`django.db.models.options.Options` class), a number of methods have been\ndeprecated and will be removed in Django 1.10:\n\n* ``get_all_field_names()``\n* ``get_all_related_objects()``\n* ``get_all_related_objects_with_model()``\n* ``get_all_related_many_to_many_objects()``\n* ``get_all_related_m2m_objects_with_model()``\n* ``get_concrete_fields_with_model()``\n* ``get_field_by_name()``\n* ``get_fields_with_model()``\n* ``get_m2m_with_model()``\n\nA :ref:`migration guide <migrating-old-meta-api>` has been provided to assist\nin converting your code from the old API to the new, official API.\n\nLoading ``cycle`` and ``firstof`` template tags from ``future`` library\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDjango 1.6 introduced ``{% load cycle from future %}`` and\n``{% load firstof from future %}`` syntax for forward compatibility of the\n:ttag:`cycle` and :ttag:`firstof` template tags. This syntax is now deprecated\nand will be removed in Django 1.10. You can simply remove the\n``{% load ... from future %}`` tags.\n\n``django.conf.urls.patterns()``\n-------------------------------\n\nIn the olden days of Django, it was encouraged to reference views as strings\nin ``urlpatterns``::\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        url('^$', 'myapp.views.myview'),\n    )\n\nand Django would magically import ``myapp.views.myview`` internally and turn\nthe string into a real function reference. In order to reduce repetition when\nreferencing many views from the same module, the ``patterns()`` function takes\na required initial ``prefix`` argument which is prepended to all\nviews-as-strings in that set of ``urlpatterns``::\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('myapp.views',\n        url('^$', 'myview'),\n        url('^other/$', 'otherview'),\n    )\n\nIn the modern era, we have updated the tutorial to instead recommend importing\nyour views module and referencing your view functions (or classes) directly.\nThis has a number of advantages, all deriving from the fact that we are using\nnormal Python in place of \"Django String Magic\": the errors when you mistype a\nview name are less obscure, IDEs can help with autocompletion of view names,\netc.\n\nSo these days, the above use of the ``prefix`` arg is much more likely to be\nwritten (and is better written) as::\n\n    from myapp import views\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        url('^$', views.myview),\n        url('^other/$', views.otherview),\n    )\n\nThus ``patterns()`` serves little purpose and is a burden when teaching new users\n(answering the newbie's question \"why do I need this empty string as the first\nargument to ``patterns()``?\"). For these reasons, we are deprecating it.\nUpdating your code is as simple as ensuring that ``urlpatterns`` is a list of\n:func:`django.conf.urls.url` instances. For example::\n\n    from django.conf.urls import url\n    from myapp import views\n\n    urlpatterns = [\n        url('^$', views.myview),\n        url('^other/$', views.otherview),\n    ]\n\nPassing a string as ``view`` to :func:`~django.conf.urls.url`\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated to the previous item, referencing views as strings in the ``url()``\nfunction is deprecated. Pass the callable view as described in the previous\nsection instead.\n\nTemplate-related settings\n-------------------------\n\nAs a consequence of the multiple template engines refactor, several settings\nare deprecated in favor of :setting:`TEMPLATES`:\n\n* ``ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS``\n* ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``\n* ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG``\n* ``TEMPLATE_DIRS``\n* ``TEMPLATE_LOADERS``\n* ``TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID``\n\n``django.core.context_processors``\n----------------------------------\n\nBuilt-in template context processors have been moved to\n``django.template.context_processors``.\n\n``django.test.SimpleTestCase.urls``\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe attribute ``SimpleTestCase.urls`` for specifying URLconf configuration in\ntests has been deprecated and will be removed in Django 1.10. Use\n:func:`@override_settings(ROOT_URLCONF=...) <django.test.override_settings>`\ninstead.\n\n``prefix`` argument to :func:`~django.conf.urls.i18n.i18n_patterns`\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated to the previous item, the ``prefix`` argument to\n:func:`django.conf.urls.i18n.i18n_patterns` has been deprecated. Simply pass a\nlist of :func:`django.conf.urls.url` instances instead.\n\nUsing an incorrect count of unpacked values in the :ttag:`for` template tag\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUsing an incorrect count of unpacked values in :ttag:`for` tag will raise an\nexception rather than fail silently in Django 1.10.\n\nPassing a dotted path to ``reverse()`` and :ttag:`url`\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nReversing URLs by Python path is an expensive operation as it causes the\npath being reversed to be imported. This behavior has also resulted in a\n`security issue`_. Use :ref:`named URL patterns <naming-url-patterns>`\nfor reversing instead.\n\nIf you are using :mod:`django.contrib.sitemaps`, add the ``name`` argument to\nthe ``url`` that references :func:`django.contrib.sitemaps.views.sitemap`::\n\n    from django.contrib.sitemaps.views import sitemap\n\n    url(r'^sitemap\\.xml$', sitemap, {'sitemaps': sitemaps},\n        name='django.contrib.sitemaps.views.sitemap')\n\nto ensure compatibility when reversing by Python path is removed in Django 1.10.\n\nSimilarly for GIS sitemaps, add ``name='django.contrib.gis.sitemaps.views.kml'``\nor ``name='django.contrib.gis.sitemaps.views.kmz'``.\n\nIf you are using a Python path for the :setting:`LOGIN_URL` or\n:setting:`LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` setting, use the name of the ``url()`` instead.\n\n.. _security issue: https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/apr/21/security/#s-issue-unexpected-code-execution-using-reverse\n\nAggregate methods and modules\n-----------------------------\n\nThe ``django.db.models.sql.aggregates`` and\n``django.contrib.gis.db.models.sql.aggregates`` modules (both private API), have\nbeen deprecated as ``django.db.models.aggregates`` and\n``django.contrib.gis.db.models.aggregates`` are now also responsible\nfor SQL generation. The old modules will be removed in Django 1.10.\n\nIf you were using the old modules, see :doc:`Query Expressions\n</ref/models/expressions>` for instructions on rewriting custom aggregates\nusing the new stable API.\n\nThe following methods and properties of ``django.db.models.sql.query.Query``\nhave also been deprecated and the backwards compatibility shims will be removed\nin Django 1.10:\n\n* ``Query.aggregates``, replaced by ``annotations``.\n* ``Query.aggregate_select``, replaced by ``annotation_select``.\n* ``Query.add_aggregate()``, replaced by ``add_annotation()``.\n* ``Query.set_aggregate_mask()``, replaced by ``set_annotation_mask()``.\n* ``Query.append_aggregate_mask()``, replaced by ``append_annotation_mask()``.\n\nExtending management command arguments through ``Command.option_list``\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nManagement commands now use :py:mod:`argparse` instead of :py:mod:`optparse` to\nparse command-line arguments passed to commands. This also means that the way\nto add custom arguments to commands has changed: instead of extending the\n``option_list`` class list, you should now override the\n:meth:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand.add_arguments` method and add\narguments through ``argparse.add_argument()``. See\n:ref:`this example <custom-commands-options>` for more details.\n\n``django.core.management.NoArgsCommand``\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe class ``NoArgsCommand`` is now deprecated and will be removed in Django\n1.10. Use :class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand` instead, which takes no\narguments by default.\n\nListing all migrations in a project\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe ``--list`` option of the :djadmin:`migrate` management command is\ndeprecated and will be removed in Django 1.10. Use :djadmin:`showmigrations`\ninstead.\n\n``cache_choices`` option of ``ModelChoiceField`` and ``ModelMultipleChoiceField``\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:class:`~django.forms.ModelChoiceField` and\n:class:`~django.forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField` took an undocumented, untested\noption ``cache_choices``. This cached querysets between multiple renderings of\nthe same ``Form`` object. This option is subject to an accelerated deprecation\nand will be removed in Django 1.9.\n\n``django.template.resolve_variable()``\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe function has been informally marked as \"Deprecated\" for some time. Replace\n``resolve_variable(path, context)`` with\n``django.template.Variable(path).resolve(context)``.\n\n``django.contrib.webdesign``\n----------------------------\n\nIt provided the :ttag:`lorem` template tag which is now included in the\nbuilt-in tags. Simply remove ``'django.contrib.webdesign'`` from\n:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` and ``{% load webdesign %}`` from your templates.\n\n``error_message`` argument to ``django.forms.RegexField``\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt provided backwards compatibility for pre-1.0 code, but its functionality is\nredundant. Use ``Field.error_messages['invalid']`` instead.\n\nOld :tfilter:`unordered_list` syntax\n------------------------------------\n\nAn older (pre-1.0), more restrictive and verbose input format for the\n:tfilter:`unordered_list` template filter has been deprecated::\n\n    ``['States', [['Kansas', [['Lawrence', []], ['Topeka', []]]], ['Illinois', []]]]``\n\nUsing the new syntax, this becomes::\n\n    ``['States', ['Kansas', ['Lawrence', 'Topeka'], 'Illinois']]``\n\n``django.forms.Field._has_changed()``\n-------------------------------------\n\nRename this method to :meth:`~django.forms.Field.has_changed` by removing the\nleading underscore. The old name will still work until Django 1.10.\n\n``django.utils.html.remove_tags()`` and ``removetags`` template filter\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n``django.utils.html.remove_tags()`` as well as the template filter\n``removetags`` have been deprecated as they cannot guarantee safe output. Their\nexistence is likely to lead to their use in security-sensitive contexts where\nthey are not actually safe.\n\nThe unused and undocumented ``django.utils.html.strip_entities()`` function has\nalso been deprecated.\n\n``is_admin_site`` argument to ``django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset()``\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's a legacy option that should no longer be necessary.\n\n``SubfieldBase``\n----------------\n\n``django.db.models.fields.subclassing.SubfieldBase`` has been deprecated and\nwill be removed in Django 1.10. Historically, it was used to handle fields where\ntype conversion was needed when loading from the database, but it was not used\nin ``.values()`` calls or in aggregates. It has been replaced with\n:meth:`~django.db.models.Field.from_db_value`.\n\nThe new approach doesn't call the :meth:`~django.db.models.Field.to_python`\nmethod on assignment as was the case with ``SubfieldBase``. If you need that\nbehavior, reimplement the ``Creator`` class `from Django's source code\n<https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.8.x/django/db/models/fields/subclassing.py#L31-L44>`_\nin your project.\n\n``django.utils.checksums``\n--------------------------\n\nThe ``django.utils.checksums`` module has been deprecated and will be removed\nin Django 1.10. The functionality it provided (validating checksum using the\nLuhn algorithm) was undocumented and not used in Django. The module has been\nmoved to the `django-localflavor`_ package (version 1.1+).\n\n.. _django-localflavor: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-localflavor\n\n``InlineAdminForm.original_content_type_id``\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe ``original_content_type_id`` attribute on ``InlineAdminForm`` has been\ndeprecated and will be removed in Django 1.10. Historically, it was used\nto construct the \"view on site\" URL. This URL is now accessible using the\n``absolute_url`` attribute of the form.\n\n``django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin.get_form()``\u2019s ``form_class`` argument\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n``FormMixin`` subclasses that override the ``get_form()`` method should make\nsure to provide a default value for the ``form_class`` argument since it's\nnow optional.\n\nRendering templates loaded by :func:`~django.template.loader.get_template()` with a :class:`~django.template.Context`\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe return type of :func:`~django.template.loader.get_template()` has changed\nin Django 1.8: instead of a :class:`django.template.Template`, it returns a\n``Template`` instance whose exact type depends on which backend loaded it.\n\nBoth classes provide a ``render()`` method, however, the former takes a\n:class:`django.template.Context` as an argument while the latter expects a\n:class:`dict`. This change is enforced through a deprecation path for Django\ntemplates.\n\nSince it's easier to understand with examples, the :ref:`upgrade guide\n<get_template-upgrade-django-18>` shows how to adapt affected code.\n\nAll this also applies to :func:`~django.template.loader.select_template()`.\n\n:class:`~django.template.Template` and :class:`~django.template.Context` classes in template responses\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome methods of :class:`~django.template.response.SimpleTemplateResponse` and\n:class:`~django.template.response.TemplateResponse` accepted\n:class:`django.template.Context` and :class:`django.template.Template` objects\nas arguments. They should now receive :class:`dict` and backend-dependent\ntemplate objects respectively.\n\nThis also applies to the return types if you have subclassed either template\nresponse class.\n\nCheck the :doc:`template response API documentation </ref/template-response>`\nfor details.\n\n``current_app`` argument of template-related APIs\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following functions and classes will no longer accept a ``current_app``\nparameter to set an URL namespace in Django 1.10:\n\n* ``django.shortcuts.render()``\n* ``django.template.Context()``\n* ``django.template.RequestContext()``\n* ``django.template.response.TemplateResponse()``\n\nSet ``request.current_app`` instead, where ``request`` is the first argument\nto these functions or classes. If you're using a plain ``Context``, use a\n``RequestContext`` instead.\n\n``dictionary`` and ``context_instance`` arguments of rendering functions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following functions will no longer accept the ``dictionary`` and\n``context_instance`` parameters in Django 1.10:\n\n* ``django.shortcuts.render()``\n* ``django.shortcuts.render_to_response()``\n* ``django.template.loader.render_to_string()``\n\nUse the ``context`` parameter instead. When ``dictionary`` is passed as a\npositional argument, which is the most common idiom, no changes are needed.\n\nIf you're passing a :class:`~django.template.Context` in ``context_instance``,\npass a :class:`dict` in the ``context`` parameter instead. If you're passing a\n:class:`~django.template.RequestContext`, pass the request separately in the\n``request`` parameter.\n\n``dirs`` argument of template-finding functions\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe following functions will no longer accept a ``dirs`` parameter to override\n``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` in Django 1.10:\n\n* :func:`django.template.loader.get_template()`\n* :func:`django.template.loader.select_template()`\n* :func:`django.shortcuts.render()`\n* ``django.shortcuts.render_to_response()``\n\nThe parameter didn't work consistently across different template loaders and\ndidn't work for included templates.\n\n``django.template.loader.BaseLoader``\n-------------------------------------\n\n``django.template.loader.BaseLoader`` was renamed to\n``django.template.loaders.base.Loader``. If you've written a custom template\nloader that inherits ``BaseLoader``, you must inherit ``Loader`` instead.\n\n``django.test.utils.TestTemplateLoader``\n----------------------------------------\n\nPrivate API ``django.test.utils.TestTemplateLoader`` is deprecated in favor of\n``django.template.loaders.locmem.Loader`` and will be removed in Django 1.9.\n\n.. _storage-max-length-update:\n\nSupport for the ``max_length`` argument on custom ``Storage`` classes\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n``Storage`` subclasses should add ``max_length=None`` as a parameter to\n:meth:`~django.core.files.storage.Storage.get_available_name` and/or\n:meth:`~django.core.files.storage.Storage.save` if they override either method.\nSupport for storages that do not accept this argument will be removed in\nDjango 1.10.\n\n``qn`` replaced by ``compiler``\n-------------------------------\n\nIn previous Django versions, various internal ORM methods (mostly ``as_sql``\nmethods) accepted a ``qn`` (for \"quote name\") argument, which was a reference\nto a function that quoted identifiers for sending to the database. In Django\n1.8, that argument has been renamed to ``compiler`` and is now a full\n``SQLCompiler`` instance. For backwards-compatibility, calling a\n``SQLCompiler`` instance performs the same name-quoting that the ``qn``\nfunction used to. However, this backwards-compatibility shim is immediately\ndeprecated: you should rename your ``qn`` arguments to ``compiler``, and call\n``compiler.quote_name_unless_alias(...)`` where you previously called\n``qn(...)``.\n\nDefault value of ``RedirectView.permanent``\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value of the\n:attr:`RedirectView.permanent <django.views.generic.base.RedirectView.permanent>`\nattribute will change from ``True`` to ``False`` in Django 1.9.\n\nUsing ``AuthenticationMiddleware`` without ``SessionAuthenticationMiddleware``\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n``django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware`` was\nadded in Django 1.7. In Django 1.7.2, its functionality was moved to\n``auth.get_user()`` and, for backwards compatibility, enabled only if\n``'django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware'`` appears in\n:setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.\n\nIn Django 1.10, session verification will be enabled regardless of whether or not\n``SessionAuthenticationMiddleware`` is enabled (at which point\n``SessionAuthenticationMiddleware`` will have no significance). You can add it\nto your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` sometime before then to opt-in. Please read the\n:ref:`upgrade considerations <session-invalidation-on-password-change>` first.\n\n``django.contrib.sitemaps.FlatPageSitemap``\n-------------------------------------------\n\n``django.contrib.sitemaps.FlatPageSitemap`` has moved to\n``django.contrib.flatpages.sitemaps.FlatPageSitemap``. The old import location\nis deprecated and will be removed in Django 1.9.\n\nModel ``Field.related``\n-----------------------\n\nPrivate attribute ``django.db.models.Field.related`` is deprecated in favor\nof ``Field.rel``.  The latter is an instance of\n``django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignObjectRel`` which replaces\n``django.db.models.related.RelatedObject``. The ``django.db.models.related``\nmodule has been removed and the ``Field.related`` attribute will be removed in\nDjango 1.10.\n\n``ssi`` template tag\n--------------------\n\nThe ``ssi`` template tag allows files to be included in a template by\nabsolute path. This is of limited use in most deployment situations, and\nthe :ttag:`include` tag often makes more sense. This tag is now deprecated and\nwill be removed in Django 1.10.\n\n``=`` as comparison operator in ``if`` template tag\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nUsing a single equals sign with the ``{% if %}`` template tag for equality\ntesting was undocumented and untested. It's now deprecated in favor of ``==``.\n\n``%(<foo>)s`` syntax in ``ModelFormMixin.success_url``\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe legacy ``%(<foo>)s`` syntax in :attr:`ModelFormMixin.success_url\n<django.views.generic.edit.ModelFormMixin.success_url>` is deprecated and\nwill be removed in Django 1.10.\n\n``GeoQuerySet`` aggregate methods\n---------------------------------\n\nThe ``collect()``, ``extent()``, ``extent3d()``, ``make_line()``, and\n``unionagg()`` aggregate methods are deprecated and should be replaced by their\nfunction-based aggregate equivalents (``Collect``, ``Extent``, ``Extent3D``,\n``MakeLine``, and ``Union``).\n\n.. _deprecated-signature-of-allow-migrate:\n\nSignature of the ``allow_migrate`` router method\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe signature of the :meth:`allow_migrate` method of database routers has\nchanged from ``allow_migrate(db, model)`` to\n``allow_migrate(db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints)``.\n\nWhen ``model_name`` is set, the value that was previously given through the\n``model`` positional argument may now be found inside the ``hints`` dictionary\nunder the key ``'model'``.\n\nAfter switching to the new signature the router will also be called by the\n:class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython` and\n:class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL` operations.\n\n.. _removed-features-1.8:\n\nFeatures removed in 1.8\n=======================\n\nThese features have reached the end of their deprecation cycle and are removed\nin Django 1.8. See :ref:`deprecated-features-1.6` for details, including how to\nremove usage of these features.\n\n* ``django.contrib.comments`` is removed.\n\n* The following transaction management APIs are removed:\n\n  - ``TransactionMiddleware``\n  - the decorators and context managers ``autocommit``, ``commit_on_success``,\n    and ``commit_manually``, defined in ``django.db.transaction``\n  - the functions ``commit_unless_managed`` and ``rollback_unless_managed``,\n    also defined in ``django.db.transaction``\n  - the ``TRANSACTIONS_MANAGED`` setting\n\n* The :ttag:`cycle` and :ttag:`firstof` template tags auto-escape their\n  arguments.\n\n* The ``SEND_BROKEN_LINK_EMAILS`` setting is removed.\n\n* ``django.middleware.doc.XViewMiddleware`` is removed.\n\n* The ``Model._meta.module_name`` alias is removed.\n\n* The backward compatible shims introduced to rename ``get_query_set``\n  and similar queryset methods are removed. This affects the following classes:\n  ``BaseModelAdmin``, ``ChangeList``, ``BaseCommentNode``,\n  ``GenericForeignKey``, ``Manager``, ``SingleRelatedObjectDescriptor`` and\n  ``ReverseSingleRelatedObjectDescriptor``.\n\n* The backward compatible shims introduced to rename the attributes\n  ``ChangeList.root_query_set`` and ``ChangeList.query_set`` are removed.\n\n* ``django.views.defaults.shortcut`` and ``django.conf.urls.shortcut`` are\n  removed.\n\n* Support for the Python Imaging Library (PIL) module is removed.\n\n* The following private APIs are removed:\n\n  - ``django.db.backend``\n  - ``django.db.close_connection()``\n  - ``django.db.backends.creation.BaseDatabaseCreation.set_autocommit()``\n  - ``django.db.transaction.is_managed()``\n  - ``django.db.transaction.managed()``\n\n* ``django.forms.widgets.RadioInput`` is removed.\n\n* The module ``django.test.simple`` and the class\n  ``django.test.simple.DjangoTestSuiteRunner`` are removed.\n\n* The module ``django.test._doctest`` is removed.\n\n* The ``CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ANONYMOUS_ONLY`` setting is removed. This change\n  affects both ``django.middleware.cache.CacheMiddleware`` and\n  ``django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware`` despite the lack of a\n  deprecation warning in the latter class.\n\n* Usage of the hard-coded *Hold down \"Control\", or \"Command\" on a Mac, to select\n  more than one.* string to override or append to user-provided ``help_text`` in\n  forms for ``ManyToMany`` model fields is not performed by Django anymore\n  either at the model or forms layer.\n\n* The ``Model._meta.get_(add|change|delete)_permission`` methods are removed.\n\n* The session key ``django_language`` is no longer read for backwards\n  compatibility.\n\n* Geographic Sitemaps are removed\n  (``django.contrib.gis.sitemaps.views.index`` and\n  ``django.contrib.gis.sitemaps.views.sitemap``).\n\n* ``django.utils.html.fix_ampersands``, the ``fix_ampersands`` template filter,\n  and ``django.utils.html.clean_html`` are removed.\n",

[Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Haystack's reserved field names are now configurable. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE: ``auto_query`` has changed so that only double\n  quotes cause exact match searches. Thanks to craigds for the report!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs on handling content-type specific output in results.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added tests for ``content_type``. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs on boosting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the ``searchfield_api`` docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- ``template_name`` can be a list of templates passed to\n  ``loader.select_template``. Thanks to zifot for the suggestion.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved handle_facet_parameters call into FacetField's __init__. [Travis\n  Cline]\n\n- Updated the pysolr dependency docs & added a debugging note about\n  boost support. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Starting the beta. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug with ``FacetedSearchForm`` where ``cleaned_data`` may not\n  exist. Thanks to imageinary for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to build epub versions of the docs. [Alfredo]\n\n- Clarified that the current supported version of Whoosh is the 1.1.1+\n  series. Thanks to glesica for the report & original patch! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- The SearchAdmin now correctly uses SEARCH_VAR instead of assuming\n  things. [Rob Hudson]\n\n- Added the ability to \"weight\" individual fields to adjust their\n  relevance. [David Sauve]\n\n- Fixed facet fieldname lookups to use the proper fieldname. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Removed unneeded imports from the Solr backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Further revamping of faceting. Each field type now has a faceted\n  variant that's created either with ``faceted=True`` or manual\n  initialization. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This should also make user-created field types possible, as many of the gross ``isinstance`` checks were removed.\n\n- Fixes SearchQuerySet not pickleable. Patch by oyiptong, tests by\n  toastdriven. [oyiptong]\n\n- Added the ability to remove objects from the index that are no longer\n  in the database to the ``update_index`` management command. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added a ``range`` filter type. Thanks to davisp & lukesneeringer for\n  the suggestion! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Note that integer ranges are broken on the current Whoosh (1.1.1). However, date & character ranges seem to work fine.\n\n- Consistency. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Ensured that multiple calls to ``count`` don't result in multiple\n  queries. Thanks to Nagyman and others for the report! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Ensure that when fetching the length of a result set that the whole\n  index isn't consumed (especially on Whoosh & Xapian). [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Really fixed dict ordering bugs in SearchSite. [Travis Cline]\n\n- Changed how you query for facets and how how they are presented in the\n  facet counts.  Allows customization of facet field names in indexes.\n  [Travis Cline]\n\n  Lightly backward-incompatible (git only).\n\n- Made it easier to override ``SearchView/SearchForm`` behavior when no\n  query is present. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  No longer do you need to override both ``SearchForm`` & ``SearchView`` if you want to return all results. Use the built-in ``SearchView``, provide your own custom ``SearchForm`` subclass & override the ``no_query_found`` method per the docstring.\n\n- Don't assume that any pk castable to an integer should be an integer.\n  [Carl Meyer]\n\n- Fetching a list of all fields now produces correct results regardless\n  of dict-ordering. Thanks to carljm & veselosky for the report! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added notes about what is needed to make schema-building independent\n  of dict-ordering. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Sorted model order matters. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Prevent Whoosh from erroring if the ``end_offset`` is less than or\n  equal to 0. Thanks to zifot for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed insecure use of ``eval`` from the Whoosh backend. Thanks to\n  SmileyChris for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Disallow ``indexed=False`` on ``FacetFields``. Thanks to jefftriplett\n  for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ``FacetField`` & changed the way facets are processed. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n  Facet data is no longer quietly duplicated just before it goes into the index. Instead, full fields are created (with all the standard data & methods) to contain the faceted information.\n\n  This change is backward-compatible, but allows for better extension, not requiring data duplication into an unfaceted field and a little less magic.\n\n- EmptyQuerySet.facet_counts() won't hit the backend. [Chris Adams]\n\n  This avoids an unnecessary extra backend query displaying the default\n  faceted search form.\n\n- TextMate fail. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed ``__name__`` to an attribute on ``SearchView`` to work with\n  decorators. Thanks to trybik for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed some wording on the tutorial to indicate where the data\n  template should go. Thanks for the suggestion Davepar! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Merge branch 'whoosh-1.1' [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Final cleanup before merging Whoosh 1.1 branch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Final Whoosh 1.1.1 fixes. Waiting for an official release of Whoosh &\n  hand testing, then this ought to be merge-able. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Upgraded the Whoosh backend to 1.1. Still one remaining test failure\n  and two errors. Waiting on mchaput's thoughts/patches. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Mistakenly committed this change. This bug is not fixed. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Better handling of attempts at loading backends when the various\n  supporting libraries aren't installed. Thanks to traviscline for the\n  report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed random test failures from not running the Solr tests in awhile.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed mlt test to use a set comparison to eliminate failures due to\n  ordering differences. [Travis Cline]\n\n- Sped up Solr backend tests by moving away from RealTimeSearchIndex\n  since it was adding objects to Solr when loading fixtures. [Travis\n  Cline]\n\n- Automatically add ``suggestion`` to the context if\n  ``HAYSTACK_INCLUDE_SPELLING`` is set. Thanks to notanumber for the\n  suggestion! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added apollo13 to AUTHORS for the ``SearchForm.__init__`` cleanup.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Use kwargs.pop instead of try/except. [Florian Apolloner]\n\n- Added Rob to AUTHORS for the admin cleanup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed selection_note text by adding missing zero. [Rob Hudson]\n\n- Fixed full_result_count in admin search results. [Rob Hudson]\n\n- Fixed admin actions in admin search results. [Rob Hudson]\n\n- Added DevCheatSheet to \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Christchurch Art Gallery to \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Forgot to include ghostrocket as submitting a patch on the previous\n  commit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a serious bug in the ``simple`` backend that would flip the\n  object instance and class. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated Whoosh to 0.3.18. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated NASA's use of Haystack in \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed how ``ModelSearchIndex`` introspects to accurately use\n  ``IntegerField`` instead of ``FloatField`` as it was using. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added CongresoVisible to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a test to verify a previous change to the ``simple`` backend.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the new admin bits to not explode on Django 1.1. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added ``SearchModelAdmin``, which enables Haystack-based search within\n  the admin. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug when not specifying a ``limit`` when using the\n  ``more_like_this`` template tag. Thanks to symroe for the original\n  patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the error messages that occur when looking up attributes on a\n  model. Thanks to acdha for the patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added pagination to the example search template in the docs so it's\n  clear that it is supported. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed copy-paste foul in ``Installing Search Engines`` docs. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the ``simple`` backend to return ``SearchResult`` instances, not\n  just bare model instances. Thanks to Agos for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the ``clear_index`` management command to respect\n  ``--verbosity``. Thanks to kylemacfarlane for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the ``simple`` backend to only search textual fields. This\n  makes the backend work consistently across all databases and is likely\n  the desired behavior anyhow. Thanks to kylemacfarlane for the report.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the ``Highlighter`` which would double-highlight HTML\n  tags. Thanks to EmilStenstrom for the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Updated management command docs to mention all options that are\n  accepted. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the Whoosh backend to correctly clear the index when using the\n  ``RAMStorage`` backend. Thanks to kylemacfarlane for the initial\n  patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed ``SearchView`` to allow more control over how many results are\n  shown per page. Thanks to simonw for the suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Ignore ``.pyo`` files when listing out the backend options. Thanks to\n  kylemacfarlane for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added CustomMade to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved a backend import to allow changing the backend Haystack uses on\n  the fly. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Useful for testing.\n\n- Added more debugging information to the docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added DeliverGood.org to the \"Who Uses\" docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added an settings override on ``HAYSTACK_LIMIT_TO_REGISTERED_MODELS``\n  as a possible performance optimization. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to pickle ``SearchResult`` objects. Thanks to dedsm\n  for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs and fixed tests on the backend loading portions. Thanks to\n  kylemacfarlane for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug with ``build_solr_schema`` where ``stored=False`` would be\n  ignored. Thanks to johnthedebs for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added debugging notes for Solr. Thanks to smccully for reporting this.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed several errors in the ``simple`` backend. Thanks to notanumber\n  for the original patch.

[Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed an error in the tutorial. Thanks to bencc for pointing this out.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a warning to the docs that ``SearchQuerySet.raw_search`` does\n  not chain. Thanks to jacobstr for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed an error in the documentation on providing fields for faceting.\n  Thanks to ghostmob for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where a field that's both nullable & faceted would error\n  if no data was provided. Thanks to LarryEitel for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a regression where the built-in Haystack fields would no longer\n  facet correctly. Thanks to traviscline for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed last code snippet on the ``SearchIndex.prepare_FOO`` docs.\n  Thanks to sk1p for pointing that out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where the schema could be built improperly if similar\n  fieldnames had different options. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added to existing tests to ensure that multiple faceted fields are\n  included in the index. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Finally added a README. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note about versions of the docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Go back to the default Sphinx theme. The custom Haystack theme is too\n  much work and too little benefit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note in the tutorial about building the schema when using\n  Solr. Thanks to trey0 for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where using ``SearchQuerySet.models()`` on an unregistered\n  model would be silently ignored. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  It is still silently ignored, but now emits a warning informing the user of why they may receive more results back than they expect.\n\n- Added notes about the ``simple`` backend in the docs. Thanks to\n  notanumber for catching the omission. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed erroneous old docs about Lucene support, which never landed.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Merge branch 'master' of github.com:toastdriven/django-haystack.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed typo in the tutorial.

[Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Forkinit to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Rampframe to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added other apps documentation for Haystack-related apps. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Unified the way ``DEFAULT_OPERATOR`` is setup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- You can now override ``ITERATOR_LOAD_PER_QUERY`` with a setting if\n  you're consuming big chunks of a ``SearchQuerySet``. Thanks to\n  kylemacfarlane for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved the preparation of faceting data to a\n  ``SearchIndex.full_prepare()`` method for easier overriding. Thanks to\n  xav for the suggestion! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The ``more_like_this`` tag now silently fails if things go south.\n  Thanks to piquadrat for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a fleshed out ``simple_backend`` for basic usage + testing.\n  [David Sauve]\n\n- ``SearchView.build_form()`` now accepts a dict to pass along to the\n  form.

[Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  No more OOMs and very fast over large data sets.\n\n- Added the ``search_view_factory`` function for thread-safe use of\n  ``SearchView``. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added more to the docs about the ``SearchQuerySet.narrow()`` method to\n  describe when/why to use it. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Whoosh tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Somewhere, a reference to the old index was hanging around causing incorrect failures.\n\n- The Whoosh backed now uses the ``AsyncWriter``, which ought to provide\n  better performance. Requires Whoosh 0.3.15 or greater. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added a way to pull the correct fieldname, regardless if it's been\n  overridden or not. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs about adding new fields. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed a painful ``isinstance`` check which should make non-standard\n  usages easier. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs regarding reserved field names in Haystack. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Pushed some of the new faceting bits down in the implementation.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed unnecessary fields from the Solr schema template.

[Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in ``ModelSearchIndex`` where the ``index_fieldname``\n  would not get set. Also added a way to override it in a general\n  fashion. Thanks to traviscline for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Backend API standardization. Thanks to batiste for the report! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Removed a method that was supposed to have been removed before 1.0.\n  Oops. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to override field names within the index. Thanks to\n  traviscline for the suggestion and original patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected the AUTHORS because slai actually provided the patch. Sorry\n  about that. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refined the internals of ``ModelSearchIndex`` to be a little more\n  flexible. Thanks to traviscline for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The Whoosh backend now supports ``RamStorage`` for use with testing or\n  other non-permanent indexes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the ``Highlighter`` involving repetition and regular\n  expressions. Thanks to alanzoppa for the original patch! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the Whoosh backend when a ``MultiValueField`` is empty.\n  Thanks to alanwj for the original patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- All dynamic imports now use ``importlib``. Thanks to bfirsh for the\n  original patch mentioning this. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  A backported version of ``importlib`` is included for compatibility with Django 1.0.\n\n- Altered ``EmptySearchQuerySet`` so it's usable from templates. Thanks\n  to bfirsh for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added tests to ensure a Whoosh regression is no longer present.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in Whoosh where using just ``.models()`` would create an\n  invalid query. Thanks to ricobl for the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Forms with initial data now display it when used with SearchView.\n  Thanks to osirius for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- App order is now consistent with INSTALLED_APPS when running\n  ``update_index``. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs to reflect the recommended way to do imports in when\n  defining ``SearchIndex`` classes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This is not my preferred style but reduces the import errors some people experience.\n\n- Fixed omission of Xapian in the settings docs. Thanks to flebel for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Little bits of cleanup related to testing. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed an error in the docs related to pre-rendering data. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added Pegasus News to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected an import in forms for consistency. Thanks to bkonkle for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug where passing a customized ``site`` would not make it down\n  through the whole stack. Thanks to Peter Bengtsson for the report and\n  original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Bumped copyright years. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed Whoosh backend so most imports will raise the correct\n  exception. Thanks to shabda for the suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refactored Solr's tests to minimize reindexes. Runs ~50% faster.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a couple potential circular imports. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The same field can now have multiple query facets. Thanks to bfirsh\n  for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added schema for testing Solr. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a string interpolation bug when adding an invalid data facet.\n  Thanks to simonw for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the default highlighter to give slightly better results,\n  especially with short strings. Thanks to RobertGawron for the original\n  patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed the ``rebuild_index`` command so it can take all options that\n  can be passed to either ``clear_index`` or ``update_index``. Thanks to\n  brosner for suggesting this. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ``--noinput`` flag to ``clear_index``. Thanks to aljosa for the\n  suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the example in the template to be a little more real-world and\n  user friendly. Thanks to j0hnsmith for pointing this out. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug with the Whoosh backend where scores weren't getting\n  populated correctly. Thanks to horribtastic for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Changed ``EmptySearchQuerySet`` so it returns an empty list when\n  slicing instead of mistakenly running queries. Thanks to askfor for\n  reporting this bug. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Switched ``SearchView`` & ``FacetedSearchView`` to use\n  ``EmptySearchQuerySet`` (instead of a regular list) when there are no\n  results. Thanks to acdha for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added RedditGifts to \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Winding Road to \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ryszard's full name to AUTHORS. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added initialization bits to part of the Solr test suite. Thanks to\n  notanumber for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started the 1.1-alpha work. Apologies for not doing this sooner.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added an advanced setting for disabling Haystack's initialization in\n  the event of a conflict with other apps. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered ``SearchForm`` to use ``.is_valid()`` instead of ``.clean()``,\n  which is a more idiomatic/correct usage. Thanks to askfor for the\n  suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added MANIFEST to ignore list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Django 1.0 compatibility when using the Solr backend. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Marked Haystack as 1.0 final. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Incorrect test result from changing the documented way the\n  ``highlight`` template tag gets called. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the example in faceting documentation to provide better\n  results and explanation on the reasoning. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added further documentation about\n  ``SearchIndex``/``RealTimeSearchIndex``. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs about `SearchQuerySet.highlight`. [toastdriven]\n\n- Added further docs on `RealTimeSearchIndex`. [toastdriven]\n\n- Added documentation on the ``RealTimeSearchIndex`` class.\n  [toastdriven]\n\n- Fixed the documentation for the arguments on the `highlight` tag.\n  Thanks to lucalenardi for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed tutorial to mention where the `NoteSearchIndex` should be\n  placed. Thanks to bkeating for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Marked Haystack as 1.0.0 release candidate 1. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Haystack now requires Whoosh 0.3.5. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Last minute documentation cleanup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation about the management commands that come with\n  Haystack. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs on the template tags included with Haystack. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs on highlighting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed some unneeded legacy code that was causing conflicts when\n  Haystack was used with apps that load all models (such as `django-\n  cms2`, `localemiddleware` or `django-transmeta`). [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed old code from the `update_index` command. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered spelling suggestion test to something a little more\n  consistent. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added tests for slicing the end of a `RelatedSearchQuerySet`. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed case where `SearchQuerySet.more_like_this` would fail when using\n  deferred Models. Thanks to Alex Gaynor for the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added default logging bits to prevent \"No handlers found\" message.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE: Renamed `reindex` management command to\n  `update_index`, renamed `clear_search_index` management command to\n  `clear_index` and added a `rebuild_index` command to both clear &\n  reindex. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE: `SearchIndex` no longer hooks up\n  `post_save/post_delete` signals for the model it's registered with.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  If you use `SearchIndex`, you will have to manually cron up a `reindex` (soon to become `update_index`) management command to periodically refresh the data in your index.\n\n  If you were relying on the old behavior, please use `RealTimeSearchIndex` instead, which does hook up those signals.\n\n- Ensured that, if a `MultiValueField` is marked as `indexed=False` in\n  Whoosh, it ought not to post-process the field. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Ensured data going into the indexes round-trips properly. Fixed\n  `DateField`/`DateTimeField` handling for all backends and\n  `MultiValueField` handling in Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a customizable `highlight` template tag plus an underlying\n  `Highlighter` implementation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added more documentation about using custom `SearchIndex.prepare_FOO`\n  methods. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- With Whoosh 0.3.5+, the number of open files is greatly reduced.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected example in docs about `RelatedSearchQuerySet`. Thanks to\n  askfor for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered `SearchResult` objects to fail gracefully when the\n  model/object can't be found. Thanks to akrito for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where `auto_query` would fail to escape strings that\n  pulled out for exact matching. Thanks to jefftriplett for the report.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Brick Design to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated backend support docs slightly. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to combine `SearchQuerySet`s via `&` or `|`. Thanks\n  to reesefrancis for the suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Revised the most of the tutorial. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Better documented how user-provided data should be sanitized. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fleshed out the `SearchField` documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed formatting on ``SearchField`` documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added basic ``SearchField`` documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  More information about the kwargs and usage will be eventually needed.\n\n- Bumped the `ulimit` so Whoosh tests pass consistently on Mac OS X.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the `default` kwarg in `SearchField` (and subclasses) to work\n  properly from a user's perspective. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE: Fixed ``raw_search`` to cooperate when\n  paginating/slicing as well as many other conditions. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This no longer immediately runs the query, nor pokes at any internals. It also now takes into account other details, such as sorting & faceting.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the Whoosh backend where slicing before doing a hit\n  count could cause strange results when paginating. Thanks to\n  kylemacfarlane for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The Whoosh tests now deal with the same data set as the Solr tests and\n  cover various aspects better. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started to pull out the real-time, signal-based updates out of the\n  main `SearchIndex` class. Backward compatible for now. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed docs to include `utils` documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated instructions for installing `pysolr`. Thanks to sboisen for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added acdha to AUTHORS for previous commit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added exception handling to the Solr Backend to silently fail/log when\n  Solr is unavailable. Thanks to acdha for the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- The `more_like_this` tag is now tested within the suite. Also has lots\n  of cleanup for the other Solr tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- On both the Solr & Whoosh backends, don't do an update if there's\n  nothing being updated. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved Haystack's internal fields out of the backends and into\n  `SearchIndex.prepare`. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This is both somewhat more DRY as well as a step toward Haystack being useful to non-Django projects.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the `build_schema` where fields that aren't supposed to\n  be indexed are still getting post-procesed by Solr. Thanks to Jonathan\n  Slenders for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added HUGE to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug in Whoosh where it would always generate spelling\n  suggestions off the full query even when given a different query\n  string to check against. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Simplified the SQ object and removed a limitation on kwargs/field\n  names that could be passed in. Thanks to traviscline for the patch.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation on `should_update` fixed to match the new signature.\n  Thanks to kylemacfarlane for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed missing words in Best Practices documentation. Thanks to\n  frankwiles for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The `update_object` method now passes along kwargs as needed to the\n  `should_update` method. Thanks to askfor for the suggestion. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs about the removal of the Whoosh fork. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed extraneous `BadSearchIndex3` from test suite. Thanks\n  notanumber! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- We actually want `repr`, not `str`. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Pushed the `model_attr` check lower down into the `SearchField` and\n  make it occur later, so that exceptions come at a point where Django\n  can better deal with them. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed attempting to access an invalid `model_attr`. Thanks to\n  notanumber for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added SQ objects (replacing the QueryFilter object) as the means to\n  generate queries/query fragments. Thanks to traviscline for all the\n  hard work. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  The SQ object is similar to Django's Q object and allows for arbitrarily complex queries. Only backward incompatible if you were relying on the SearchQuery/QueryFilter APIs.\n\n- Reformatted debugging docs a bit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added debugging information about the Whoosh lock error. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Brought the TODO up to date. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a warning to the documentation about how `__startswith` may not\n  always provide the expected results. Thanks to codysoyland for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added debugging documentation, with more examples coming in the\n  future. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a new `basic_search` view as a both a working example of how to\n  write traditional views and as a thread-safe view, which the class-\n  based ones may/may not be. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed sample template in the documentation. Thanks to lemonad for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated documentation to include a couple more Sphinx directives.\n  Index is now more useful. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Made links more obvious in documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added an `example_project` demonstrating how a sample project might be\n  setup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed `load_backend` to use the argument passed instead of always the\n  `settings.HAYSTACK_SEARCH_ENGINE`. Thanks to newgene for the report.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Regression where sometimes `narrow_queries` got juggled into a list\n  when it should be a set everywhere. Thanks tcline & ericholscher for\n  the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the Whoosh backend's version requirement to reflect the fully\n  working version of Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- With the latest SVN version of Whoosh (r344), `SearchQuerySet()` now\n  works properly in Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a `FacetedModelSearchForm`. Thanks to mcroydon for the original\n  patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added translation capabilities to the `SearchForm` variants. Thanks to\n  hejsan for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added AllForLocal to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The underlying caching has been fixed so it no longer has to fill the\n  entire cache before it to ensure consistency. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This results in significantly faster slicing and reduced memory usage. The test suite is more complete and ensures this functionality better.\n\n  This also removes `load_all_queryset` from the main `SearchQuerySet` implementation. If you were relying on this behavior, you should use `RelatedSearchQuerySet` instead.\n\n- Log search queries with `DEBUG = True` for debugging purposes, similar\n  to what Django does. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated LJ's Who Uses information. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Sunlight Labs & NASA to the Who Uses list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Eldarion to the Who Uses list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- When more of the cache is populated, provide a more accurate `len()`\n  of the `SearchQuerySet`. This ought to only affect advanced usages,\n  like excluding previously-registered models or `load_all_queryset`.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where `SearchQuerySet`s longer than `REPR_OUTPUT_SIZE`\n  wouldn't include a note about truncation when `__repr__` is called.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to choose which site is used when reindexing. Thanks\n  to SmileyChris for pointing this out and the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the lack of a `__unicode__` method on `SearchResult` objects.\n  Thanks to mint_xian for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Typo'd the setup.py changes. Thanks to jlilly for catching that.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Converted all query strings to Unicode for Whoosh. Thanks to simonw108\n  for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added template tags to `setup.py`. Thanks to Bogdan for pointing this\n  out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added two more tests to the Whoosh backend, just to make sure. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected the way Whoosh handles `order_by`. Thanks to Rowan for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- For the Whoosh backend, ensure the directory is writable by the\n  current user to try to prevent failed writes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a better label to the main search form field. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Bringing the Whoosh backend up to version 0.3.0b14. This version of\n  Whoosh has better query parsing, faster indexing and, combined with\n  these changes, should cause fewer disruptions when used in a\n  multiprocess/multithreaded environment. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added optional argument to `spelling_suggestion` that lets you provide\n  a different query than the one built by the SearchQuerySet. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n  Useful for passing along a raw user-provided query, especially when there is a lot of post-processing done.\n\n- SearchResults now obey the type of data chosen in their corresponding\n  field in the SearchIndex if present. Thanks to evgenius for the\n  original report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the Solr backend where submitting an empty string to\n  search returned an ancient and incorrect datastructure. Thanks kapa77\n  for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where the cache would never properly fill due to the\n  number of results returned being lower than the hit count. This could\n  happen when there were results excluded due to being in the index but\n  the model NOT being registered in the `SearchSite`. Thanks akrito and\n  tcline for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the docs to look more like the main site. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a (short) list of who uses Haystack. Would love to have more on\n  this list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed docs on preparing data. Thanks fud. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the `ModelSearchIndex` class for easier `SearchIndex`\n  generation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note about using possibly unsafe data with `filter/exclude`.\n  Thanks to ryszard for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Standardized the API on `date_facet`. Thanks to notanumber for the\n  original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved constructing the schema down to the `SearchBackend` level. This\n  allows more flexibility when creating a schema. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where a hyphen provided to `auto_query` could break the\n  query string. Thanks to ddanier for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - For consistency, `get_query_set` has been\n  renamed to `get_queryset` on `SearchIndex` classes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  A simple search & replace to remove the underscore should be all that is needed.\n\n- Missed two bits while updating the documentation for the Xapian\n  backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated documentation to add the Xapian backend information. A big\n  thanks to notatnumber for all his hard work on the Xapian backend.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added `EmptySearchQuerySet`. Thanks to askfor for the suggestion!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added \"Best Practices\" documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation about the `HAYSTACK_SITECONF` setting. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed erroneous documentation on Xapian not supporting boost. Thanks\n  notanumber! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - The `haystack.autodiscover()` and other site\n  modifications now get their own configuration file and should no\n  longer be placed in the `ROOT_URLCONF`. Thanks to SmileyChris for the\n  original patch and patrys for further feedback. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added `verbose_name_plural` to the `SearchResult` object. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added a warning about ordering by integers with the Whoosh backend.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note about ordering and accented characters. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the `more_like_this` tag to allow for narrowing the models\n  returned by the tag. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed `null=True` for `IntegerField` and `FloatField`. Thanks to\n  ryszard for the report and original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Reverted aabdc9d4b98edc4735ed0c8b22aa09796c0a29ab as it would cause\n  mod_wsgi environments to fail in conjunction with the admin on Django\n  1.1. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the start of a glossary of terminology. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Various documentation fixes. Thanks to sk1p & notanumber. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- The `haystack.autodiscover()` and other site modifications may now be\n  placed in ANY URLconf, not just the `ROOT_URLCONF`. Thanks to\n  SmileyChris for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed invalid/empty pages in the SearchView. Thanks to joep and\n  SmileyChris for patches. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note and an exception about consistent fieldnames for the\n  document field across all `SearchIndex` classes. Thanks sk1p\\_! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Possible thread-safety fix related to registration handling. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - The 'boost' method no longer takes kwargs.\n  This makes boost a little more useful by allowing advanced terms.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  To migrate code, convert multiple kwargs into separate 'boost' calls, quote what was the key and change the '=' to a ','.\n\n- Updated documentation to match behavioral changes to MLT. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a serious bug in MLT on Solr. Internals changed a bit and now\n  things work correctly. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed erroneous 'zip_safe' from setup.py. Thanks ephelon. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added `null=True` to fields, allowing you to ignore/skip a field when\n  indexing. Thanks to Kevin for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a standing test failure. The dummy setup can't do `load_all` due\n  to mocking. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added initial `additional_query` to MLT to allow for narrowing\n  results. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed nasty bug where results would get duplicated due to cached\n  results. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered `ITERATOR_LOAD_PER_QUERY` from 20 to 10. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected tutorial when dealing with fields that have\n  `use_template=True`. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated documentation to reflect basic Solr setup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fix documentation on grabbing Whoosh and on the 'load_all' parameter\n  for SearchForms. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug where the '__in' filter wouldn't work with phrases or data\n  types other than one-word string/integer. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug so that the 'load_all' option in 'SearchView' now actually\n  does what it says it should. How embarrassing... [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ability to specify custom QuerySets for loading records via\n  'load_all'/'load_all_queryset'. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where results from non-registered models could appear in\n  the results. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - Changed 'module_name' to 'model_name'\n  throughout Haystack related to SearchResult objects. Only incompatible\n  if you were relying on this attribute. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to fetch additional and stored fields from a\n  SearchResult as well as documentation on the SearchResult itself.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to look through relations in SearchIndexes via '__'.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added note about the 'text' fieldname convention. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added an 'update_object' and 'remove_object' to the SearchSite objects\n  as a shortcut. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Recover gracefully from queries Whoosh judges to be invalid. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Missed test from previous commit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added stemming support to Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed the commented version. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Django 1.0.X compatibility fix for the reindex command. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Reindexes should now consume a lot less RAM. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Evidently, when you run a ton of queries touching virtually everything in your DB, you need to clean out the \"logged\" queries from the connection. Sad but true.\n\n- Altered `SearchBackend.remove` and `SearchBackend.get_identifier` to\n  accept an object or a string identifier (in the event the object is no\n  longer available). [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This is useful in an environment where you no longer have the original object on hand and know what it is you wish to delete.\n\n- Added a simple (read: ghetto) way to run the test suite without having\n  to mess with settings. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a setting `HAYSTACK_BATCH_SIZE` to control how many objects are\n  processed at once when running a reindex. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed import that was issuing a warning. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Further tests to make sure `unregister` works appropriately as well,\n  just to be paranoid. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bizarre bug where backends may see a different site object\n  than the rest of the application code. THIS REQUIRES SEARCH &\n  REPLACING ALL INSTANCES OF `from haystack.sites import site` TO `from\n  haystack import site`. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  No changes needed if you've been using `haystack.autodiscover()`.\n\n- Pushed save/delete signal registration down to the SearchIndex level.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This should make it easier to alter how individual indexes are setup, allowing you to queue updates, prevent deletions, etc. The internal API changed slightly.\n\n- Created a default 'clean' implementation, as the first three (and soon\n  fourth) backends all use identical code. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated tests to match new 'model_choices'. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added timeout support to Solr. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Capitalize the Models in the model_choices. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed unnecessary import. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- No longer need to watch for DEBUG in the 'haystack_info' command.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug in Whoosh backend when spelling suggestions are disabled.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a \"clear_search_index\" management command. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed comments as pysolr now supports timeouts and the other comment\n  no longer applies. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed Solr-flavored schema bits. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Still need to work out a better way to handle user created fields that don't fit neatly into subclassing one of the core Field types.\n\n- Moved informational messages to a management command to behave better\n  when using dumpdata or wsgi. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed some Solr-specific field names. Requires a reindex. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Typo'd docstring. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed empty test file from spelling testing. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation for getting spelling support working on Solr. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Initial spelling support added. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a 'more_like_this' template tag. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed an unnecessary 'run'. This cause MLT (and potentially\n  'raw_search') to fail by overwriting the results found. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added Whoosh failure. Needs inspecting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Finally added views/forms documentation. A touch rough still. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in FacetedSearchView where a SearchQuerySet method could\n  be called on an empty list instead. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More faceting documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started faceting documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs to finally include details about faceting. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Empty or one character searches in Whoosh returned the wrong data\n  structure. Thanks for catching this, silviogutierrez! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added scoring to Whoosh now that 0.1.20+ support it. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the Solr tests due to recent changes in pysolr. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation on the 'narrow' method. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added additional keyword arguments on raw_search. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added 'narrow' support in Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Whoosh backend's handling of pre-1900 dates. Thanks JoeGermuska!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Backed out the Whoosh quoted dates patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Something still seems amiss in the Whoosh query parser, as ranges and dates together don't seem to get parsed together properly.\n\n- Added a small requirements section to the docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added notes about enabling the MoreLikeThisHandler within Solr.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Revised how tests are done so each backend now gets its own test app.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  All tests pass once again.\n\n- Added 'startswith' filter. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the __repr__ method on QueryFilters. Thanks JoeGermuska for the\n  original patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE - Both the Solr & Whoosh backends now provide\n  native Python types back in SearchResults. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This also allows Whoosh to use native types better from the 'SearchQuerySet' API itself.\n\n  This unfortunately will also require all Whoosh users to reindex, as the way some data (specifically datetimes/dates but applicable to others) is stored in the index.\n\n- SearchIndexes now support inheritance. Thanks smulloni! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added FacetedSearchForm to make handling facets easier. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Heavily refactored the SearchView to take advantage of being a class.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  It should now be much easier to override bits without having to copy-paste the entire __call__ method, which was more than slightly embarrassing before.\n\n- Fixed Solr backend so that it properly converts native Python types to\n  something Solr can handle. Thanks smulloni for the original patch!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- SearchResults now include a verbose name for display purposes. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed reverse order_by's when using Whoosh. Thanks matt_c for the\n  original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Handle Whoosh stopwords behavior when provided a single character\n  query string. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Lightly refactored tests to only run engines with their own settings.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Typo'd the tutorial when setting up your own SearchSite. Thanks\n  mcroydon! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered loading statements to only display when DEBUG is True. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Write to STDERR where appropriate. Thanks zerok for suggesting this\n  change. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - Altered the search query param to 'q' instead\n  of 'query'. Thanks simonw for prompting this change. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed the Whoosh patch in favor of better options. Please see the\n  documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Whoosh patch for 0.1.15 to temporarily fix reindexes. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the reindex command to handle inherited models. Thanks\n  smulloni! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed the no longer needed Whoosh patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Whoosh users should upgrade to the latest Whoosh (0.1.15) as it fixes the issues that the patch covers as well as others.\n\n- Documented the 'content' shortcut. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed an incorrect bit of documentation on the default operator\n  setting. Thanks benspaulding! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation about Haystack's various settings. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected an issue with the Whoosh backend that can occur when no\n  indexes are registered. Now provides a better exception. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation fixes. Thanks benspaulding! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Whoosh patch, which should help with the \"KeyError\" exceptions\n  when searching with models. Thanks Matias Costa! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Improvements to the setup.py. Thanks jezdez & ask! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the .gitignore. Thanks ask! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- FacetedSearchView now inherits from SearchView. Thanks cyberdelia!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This will matter much more soon, as SearchView is going to be refactored to be more useful and extensible.\n\n- Documentation fixes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the whoosh patch. Should apply cleanly now. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Better linking to the search engine installation notes. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation on setting up the search engines. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Provide an exception when importing a backend dependency fails. Thanks\n  brosner for the initial patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Yay stupid typos! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Relicensing under BSD. Thanks matt_c for threatening to use my name in\n  an endorsement of a derived product! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in ModelSearchForm. Closes 1. Thanks dotsphinx! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added link to pysolr binding. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refined documentation on preparing SearchIndex data. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed existing references from 'model_name' to 'module_name'.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This was done to be consistent both internally and with Django. Thanks brosner!\n\n- Documentation improvements. Restyled and friendlier intro page.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation on preparing data. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Additions and re-prioritizing the TODO list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added warnings to Whoosh backend in place of silently ignoring\n  unsupported features. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected Xapian's capabilities. Thanks richardb! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - Altered all settings to be prefixed with\n  HAYSTACK\\_. Thanks Collin! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Test cleanup from previous commits. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed the DEFAULT_OPERATOR back to 'AND'. Thanks richardb! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the way registrations get handled. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Various fixes. Thanks brosner! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added new 'should_update' method to documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added 'should_update' method to SearchIndexes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This allows you to control, on a per-index basis, what conditions will cause an individual object to reindex. Useful for models that update frequently with changes that don't require indexing.\n\n- Added FAQ docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Alter Whoosh backend to commit regardless. This avoids locking issues\n  that can occur on higher volume sites. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- A more efficient implementation of index clearing in Whoosh. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added details about settings needed in settings.py. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added setup.py. Thanks cyberdelia for prompting it. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Reindex management command now can reindex a limited range (like last\n  24 hours). Thanks traviscline. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More things to do. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation formatting fixes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added SearchBackend docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected reST formatting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Additional TODO's. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Initial SearchIndex documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Formally introduced the TODO. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated backend support list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added initial documentation for SearchSites. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed whoosh backend to fix limiting sets. Need to revisit someday.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added patch for Whoosh backend and version notes in documentation.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Initial Whoosh backend complete. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Does not yet support highlighting or scoring.\n\n- Removed some unnecessary dummy code. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Work on trying to get the default site to load reliably in all cases.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Trimmed down the urls for tests now that the dummy backend works\n  correctly. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Dummy now correctly loads the right SearchBackend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed faceting from the default SearchView. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refactored tests so they are no longer within the haystack app.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Further benefits include less mocking and haystack's tests no longer contributing overall testing of end-user apps. Documentation included.\n\n- Removed old comment. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a potential race condition. Also, since there's no way to tell\n  when everything is ready to go in Django, adding an explicit call to\n  SearchQuerySet's __init__ to force the site to load if it hasn't\n  already. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More tests on models() support. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Pulled schema building out into the site to leverage across backends.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered backend loading for consistency with Django and fixed the\n  long-incorrect-for-non-obvious-and-tedious-reasons version number.\n  Still beta but hopefully that changes soon. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Missed a spot when fixing SearchSites. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - Created a class name conflict during the last\n  change (double use of ``SearchIndex``). Renamed original\n  ``SearchIndex`` to ``SearchSite``, which is slightly more correct\n  anyhow. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This will only affect you if you've custom built sites (i.e. not used ``autodiscover()``.\n\n- More documentation. Started docs on SearchQuery. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Further fleshed out SearchQuerySet documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE (2 of 2) - Altered autodiscover to search for\n  'search_indexes.py' instead of 'indexes.py' to prevent collisions and\n  be more descriptive. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE (1 of 2) - The ModelIndex class has been renamed\n  to be SearchIndex to make room for future improvements. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fleshed out a portion of the SearchQuerySet documentation. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- SearchQuerySet.auto_query now supports internal quoting for exact\n  matches. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed semi-serious issue with SearchQuery objects, causing bits to\n  leak from one query to the next when cloning. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered Solr port for testing purposes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Now that Solr and core feature set are solid, moved haystack into beta\n  status. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added simple capabilities for retrieving facets back. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Bugfix to make sure model choices don't get loaded until after the\n  IndexSite is populated. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Initial faceting support complete. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Query facets tested. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Bugfix to (field) facets. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Using a dict is inappropriate, as the output from Solr\n  is sorted by count. Now using a two-tuple.\n\n- Backward-incompatible changes to faceting. Date-based faceting is now\n  present. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Solr implementation of faceting started. Needs more tests. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Initial faceting support in place. Needs more thought and a Solr\n  implementation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Unbreak iterables in queries. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Bugfixes for Unicode handling and loading deleted models. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug in Solr's run method. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Various bug fixes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Backward-Incompatible: Refactored ModelIndexes to allow greater\n  customization before indexing. See \"prepare()\" methods. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Updated \"build_solr_schema\" command for revised fields. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Refactored SearchFields. Lightly backwards-incompatible. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- No more duplicates from the \"build_solr_schema\" management command.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed the kwargs. Explicit is better than implicit. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Tests for highlighting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added initial highlighting support. Needs tests and perhaps a better\n  implementation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started \"build_solr_schema\" command. Needs testing with more than one\n  index. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Argh. \".select_related()\" is killing reindexes. Again. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Stored fields now come back as part of the search result. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Solr's SearchQuery.clean to handle reserved words more\n  appropriately. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Filter types seem solid and have tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- App renamed (for namespace/sanity/because it's really different\n  reasons). [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started trying to support the various filter types. Needs testing and\n  verification. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed tests in light of the change to \"OR\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded \"select_related\" to reindex command. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- I am a moron. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- \"OR\" is now the default operator. Also, \"auto_query\" now handles\n  not'ed keywords. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- \"More Like This\" now implemented and functioning with Solr backend.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed broken references to __name__. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Internal documentation fix. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Solr backend can now clear on a per-model basis. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Solr backend tests fleshed out. Initial stability of Solr. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n  This needs more work (as does everything) but it seems to be working reliably from my testing (both unit and \"real-world\"). Onward and upward.\n\n- Massive renaming/refactoring spree. Tests 100% passing again. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Renamed BaseSearchQuerySet to SearchQuerySet. Now requires\n  instantiation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Standardizing syntax. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Backend support update. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- An attempt to make sure the main IndexSite is always setup, even\n  outside web requests. Also needs improvement. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Reindexes now work. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Some painful bits to make things work for now. Needs improvement.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Support kwargs on the search. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Move solr backend tests in prep for fully testing the backend. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Some ContentField/StoredField improvements. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  StoredFields now have a unique template per field (as they should have from the start) and there's a touch more checking. You can also now override the template name for either type of field.\n\n- Fixed backend loading upon unpickling SearchBackend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Tweak internal doc. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- MOAR DOCS. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Internal documentation and cleanup. Also alters the behavior of\n  SearchQuerySet's \"order_by\" method slightly, bringing it more in-line\n  with QuerySet's behavior. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation/license updates. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed ModelIndexes and created tests for them. 100% tests passing\n  again. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started refactoring ModelIndexes. Needs tests (and possibly a little\n  love). [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Implemented Solr's boost, clean, multiple order-by. Fixed Solr's score\n  retrieval (depends on custom pysolr) and exact match syntax. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Minor changes/cleanup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs and a FIXME. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- SearchView/SearchForm tests passing. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed BaseSearchQuery to accept a SearchBackend instance instead of\n  the class. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Better dummy implementation, a bugfix to raw_search and\n  SearchView/SearchForm tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Temporarily changed the Solr backend to ignore fields. Pysolr will\n  need a patch and then reenable this. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Merge branch 'master' of\n  ssh://danielmckenzie/home/daniel/djangosearch_refactor into HEAD.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started SearchView tests and added URLconf. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started SearchView tests and added URLconf. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added note about basic use. Needs refactoring. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Merged index.rst. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Fixed result lookups when constructing a SearchResult. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added more docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added FIXME for exploration on Solr backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Solr's SearchQuery now handles phrases (exact match). [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- More work on the Solr backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added more imports for future test coverage. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added stubs for backend tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation updates. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refactored forms/views. Needs tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed old entries in .gitignore. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Implemented load_all. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed query result retrieval. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated documentation index and tweaked overview formatting. [Matt\n  Croydon]\n\n- Slight docs improvements. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started work on Solr backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Ignore _build. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Refactored documentation to format better in Sphinx. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Added _build to .gitignore. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Added sphinx config for documentation. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Verified _fill_cache behavior. 100% test pass. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a couple new desirable bits of functionality. Mostly stubbed.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed fixme and updated docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed an old reference to SearchPaginator. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated import paths to new backend Base* location. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Relocated base backend classes to __init__.py for consistency with\n  Django. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BaseSearchQuerySet initial API complete and all but working. One\n  failing test related to caching results. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added new (improved?) template path for index templates. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Removed SearchPaginator, as it no longer provides anything over the\n  standard Django Paginator. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added len/iter support to BaseSearchQuerySet. Need to finish getitem\n  support and test. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started to update ModelIndex. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started to alter dummy to match new class names/API. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Little bits of cleanup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added overview of where functionality belongs in djangosearch. This\n  should likely make it's way into other docs and go away eventually.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BaseSearchQuery now tracks filters via QueryFilter objects. Tests\n  complete for QueryFilter and nearly complete for BaseSearchQuery.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started docs on creating new backends. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started tests for BaseSearchQuery and BaseSearchQuerySet. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed site loading. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More work on the Base* classes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started docs on creating new backends. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Yet more work on BaseSearchQuerySet. Now with fewer FIXMEs. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- More work on BaseSearchQuerySet and added initial BaseSearchQuery\n  object. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed another chunk of SearchPaginator as SearchQuerySet becomes\n  more capable. Hopefully, SearchPaginator will simply go away soon.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed ModelSearchForm to check the site's registered models. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Reenabled how other backends might load. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ignores. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started documenting what backends are supported and what they can do.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More work on SearchQuerySet. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More renovation and IndexSite's tests pass 100%. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fleshed out sites tests. Need to setup environment in order to run\n  them. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started adding tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- First blush at SearchQuerySet. Non-functional, trying to lay out API\n  and basic funationality. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed old results.py in favor of the coming SearchQuerySet. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Noted future improvements on SearchPaginator. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed old reference to autodiscover and added default site a la NFA.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Commented another use of RELEVANCE. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Little backend tweaks. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added autodiscover support. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded management command. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added SearchView and ModelSearchForm back in. Needs a little work.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded results. Need to look at SoC for ideas. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded paginator. Needs docs/tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded core backends + solr. Will add others as they reach 100%\n  functionality. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ModelIndex back in. Customized to match new setup. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added signal registration as well as some introspection capabilities.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Initial commit. Basic IndexSite implementation complete. Needs tests.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n\n",

    "gevent": [
        {
            "changelog": "==================\n\nIncompatible Changes\n--------------------\n- Support for Python 2.6 has been removed. See :pr:`766`.\n- Remove module ``gevent.coros`` which was replaced by ``gevent.lock``\n  and has been deprecated since 1.0b2.\n- The internal implementation modules ``gevent.corecext`` and\n  ``gevent.corecffi`` have been moved. Please import from\n  ``gevent.core`` instead.\n\nLibraries\n---------\n\n- Update libev to version 4.22.\n- Update tblib to 1.3.0.\n- Update c-ares to version 1.11.0 (`release notes\n  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-ares/c-ares/cares-1_11_0/RELEASE-NOTES>`_).\n- For the benefit of downstream package maintainers, gevent is now\n  tested with c-ares and libev linked dynamically and not embedded\n  (i.e., using the system libraries). However, only the versions\n  shipped with gevent are tested and known to work.\n- PyPy/CFFI: The corecffi native extension is now only built at\n  installation time. Previously, if it wasn't available, a build was\n  attempted at every import. This could lead to scattered \"gevent\"\n  directories and undependable results.\n- Update Cython to 0.24.\n- setuptools is now required at build time on all platforms.\n  Previously it was only required for Windows and PyPy.\n- POSIX: Don't hardcode ``/bin/sh`` into the configuration command\n  line, instead relying on ``sh`` being on the ``PATH``, as\n  recommended by `the standard <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html>`_.\n  Fixed in :pr:`809` by Fredrix Fornwall.\n\n\nSecurity\n--------\n- :mod:`gevent.pywsgi` now checks that the values passed to\n  ``start_response`` do not contain a carriage return or newline in\n  order to prevent HTTP response splitting (header injection), raising\n  a :exc:`ValueError` if they do. See :issue:`775`.\n- Incoming headers containing an underscore are no longer placed in\n  the WSGI environ. See :issue:`819`.\n- Errors logged by :class:`~gevent.pywsgi.WSGIHandler` no\n  longer print the entire WSGI environment by default. This avoids\n  possible information disclosure vulnerabilities. Applications can\n  also opt-in to a higher security level for the WSGI environment if they\n  choose and their frameworks support it. Originally reported\n  in :pr:`779` by sean-peters-au and changed in :pr:`781`.\n\n\nStdlib Compatibility\n--------------------\n- The modules :mod:`gevent.os`, :mod:`gevent.signal` and\n  :mod:`gevent.select` export all the attributes from their\n  corresponding standard library counterpart.\n- If :func:`gevent.select.select` is given a negative *timeout*\n  argument, raise an exception like the standard library does.\n- If :func:`gevent.select.select` is given closed or invalid\n  file descriptors in any of its lists, raise the appropriate\n  ``EBADF`` exception like the standard library does. Previously,\n  libev would tend to return the descriptor as ready. In the worst\n  case, this adds an extra system call, but may also reduce latency if\n  descriptors are ready at the time of entry.\n- :class:`selectors.SelectSelector` is properly monkey-patched\n  regardless of the order of imports. Reported in :issue:`835` by\n  Przemys\u0142aw W\u0119grzyn.\n- :meth:`gevent.select.poll.unregister` raises an exception if *fd* is not\n  registered, like the standard library.\n- :meth:`gevent.select.poll.poll` returns an event with\n  ``POLLNVAL`` for registered fds that are invalid. Previously it\n  would tend to report both read and write events.\n- Python 2: ``reload(site)`` no longer fails with a ``TypeError`` if\n  gevent has been imported. Reported in :issue:`805` by Jake Hilton.\n- Python 2: ``sendall`` on a non-blocking socket could spuriously fail\n  with a timeout.\n- ``FileObjectPosix`` exposes the ``read1`` method when in read mode,\n  and generally only exposes methods appropriate to the mode it is in.\n- ``FileObjectPosix`` supports a *bufsize* of 0 in binary write modes.\n  Reported in :issue:`840` by Mike Lang.\n- Python 3: meth:`gevent.socket.connect_ex` was letting\n  ``BlockingIOError`` (and possibly others) get raised instead of\n  returning the errno due to the refactoring of the exception\n  hierarchy in Python 3.3. Now the errno is returned. Reported in\n  :issue:`841` by Dana Powers.\n- Setting SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL after :mod:`gevent.subprocess`\n  had been used previously could not be reversed, causing\n  ``Popen.wait`` and other calls to hang. Now, if SIGCHLD has been\n  ignored, the next time :mod:`gevent.subprocess` is used this will be\n  detected and corrected automatically. (This potentially leads to\n  issues with :func:`os.popen` on Python 2, but the signal can always\n  be reset again. Mixing the low-level process handling calls,\n  low-level signal management and high-level use of\n  :mod:`gevent.subprocess` is tricky.) Reported in :issue:`857` by\n  Chris Utz.\n\nOther Changes\n-------------\n\n- :class:`~.Group` and :class:`~.Pool` now return whether\n  :meth:`~.Group.join` returned with an empty group. Suggested by Filippo Sironi in\n  :pr:`503`.\n- Servers: Default to AF_INET6 when binding to all addresses (e.g.,\n  \"\"). This supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connections (except on\n  Windows). Original change in :pr:`495` by Felix Kaiser.\n- Unhandled exception reports that kill a greenlet now include a\n  timestamp. See :issue:`137`.\n- Add :class:`gevent.threadpool.ThreadPoolExecutor` (a\n  :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` variant that always\n  uses native threads even when the system has been monkey-patched)\n  on platforms that have ``concurrent.futures``\n  available (Python 3 and Python 2 with the ``futures`` backport\n  installed). This is helpful for, e.g., grpc. Reported in\n  :issue:`786` by Markus Padourek.\n- Native threads created before monkey-patching threading can now be\n  joined. Previously on Python < 3.4, doing so would raise a\n  ``LoopExit`` error. Reported in :issue:`747` by Sergey Vasilyev.\n- pywsgi/performance: Chunks of data the application returns are no longer copied\n  before being sent to the socket when the transfer-encoding is\n  chunked, potentially reducing overhead for large responses.\n- :class:`~.PriorityQueue` now ensures that an initial items list is a\n  valid heap. Fixed in :pr:`793` by X.C.Dong.\n- On Python 2.7.9 and above (more generally, when the SSL backport is\n  present in Python 2), :func:`gevent.ssl.get_server_certificate`\n  would raise a :exc:`ValueError` if the system wasn't monkey-patched.\n  Reported in :issue:`801` by Gleb Dubovik.\n- On Python 2.7.9 and Python 3, closing an SSL socket in one greenlet\n  while it's being read from or written to in a different greenlet is\n  less likely to raise a :exc:`TypeError` instead of a\n  :exc:`ValueError`. Reported in :issue:`800` by Kevin Chen.\n- :class:`gevent.hub.signal` (aka :func:`gevent.signal`) now verifies\n  that its `handler` argument is callable, raising a :exc:`TypeError`\n  if it isn't. Reported in :issue:`818` by Peter Renstr\u00f6m.\n- If ``sys.stderr`` has been monkey-patched (not recommended),\n  exceptions that the hub reports aren't lost and can still be caught.\n  Reported in :issue:`825` by Jelle Smet.\n- The various ``FileObject`` implementations are more consistent with\n  each other.\n\n  .. note:: Writing to the *io* property of a FileObject should be\n            considered deprecated after it is constructed.\n\n",

Merge sanitizer.sanitize into the\n  sanitizer.htmlsanitizer module and move that to saniziter.

This adresses a possible attack that can be used to execute \ncode remote, if one has access to the internal locust ports that are used for master-slave \ncommunication. The reason for this exploit was due to the fact that pickle was used. \n\n.. warning::\n\n    Anyone who uses an older version should make sure that their Locust machines are not publicly \n    accessible on port 5557 and 5558. Also, one should never run Locust as root.\n\nAnyone who uses the :py:class:`report_to_master <locust.events.report_to_master>` and \n:py:class:`slave_report <locust.events.slave_report>` events, needs to make sure that \nany data that is attached to the slave reports is serializable by msgpack.\n\n",

Previously\n  these databases worked on little endian machines with libmaxminddb but did\n  not work on big endian machines. Due to increased safety checks when reading\n  the file, these databases will no longer work on any platform. If you are\n  using one of these databases, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest\n  GeoLite2 or GeoIP2 database\n* Added pkg-config support. If your system supports it, then running `make\n  install` now installs a `libmaxminddb.pc` file for pkgconfig. Implemented by\n  Jan Vcelak.\n* Several segmentation faults found with afl-fuzz were fixed. These were\n  caused by missing bounds checking and missing data type verification checks.\n* `MMDB_get_entry_data_list` will now fail on data structures with a depth\n  greater than 512 and data structures that are cyclic. This should not\n  affect any known MaxMind DB in production. All databases produced by\n  MaxMind have a depth of less than five.\n\n\n",

The standard :func:`~mosql.util.escape` and\n   :func:`~mosql.util.escape_identifier` now raise :exc:`ValueError` if its\n   argument has a null byte. A null byte may truncate the SQL when database\n   interprets it, but it still depends on how database handles it. Thanks\n   `Orange <http://blog.orange.tw>`_ for reporting this issue.\n. Removed the support to use subquery directly. Use the new\n   :func:`~mosql.util.subq` instead.\n\nAs far as we know, the two flaws can't be exploited, but we still strongly\nrecommend you to upgrade to this version.\n\nThis version, v0.10, re-passed the strictest (level=5, risk=3) sqlmap_ tests on both value and identitifer-side in the cases:\n\n- MySQL 5.6.21 with `MySQLdb <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/>`_\n  1.2.5\n- MySQL 5.6.21 with `MySQL Connector/Python\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-connector-python>`_ 2.0.2\n- PostgreSQL 9.3.5 with `Psycopg <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2>`_ 2.5.4\n\nThe Majoy Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n. The :class:`~mosql.db.Database` supports to keep connection open.\n. The :class:`~mosql.db.Database` is thread-safe now.\n. The :func:`~mosql.query.insert` supports multi-value.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.build_where` translates ``x IN ()`` into ``FALSE``.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.build_where` allows to use `pair` as key to include\n   operator.\n. The :class:`mosql.util.Statement.format` ignores false -- in bool context --\n   clause argument.\n. The :class:`mosql.util.Statement.format` raises :exc:`TypeError` if there is\n   any unused clause argument.\n. Added :meth:`mosql.util.Query.enable_echo` to echo the SQL it builds.\n\nCheck details in :class:`~mosql.db.Database` or :func:`~mosql.query.select`.\n\nThe Minor Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n. Added :func:`~mosql.util.dot`, :func:`~mosql.util.as_`,\n   :func:`~mosql.util.asc`, :func:`~mosql.util.desc`, :func:`~mosql.util.subq`,\n   and :func:`~mosql.util.in_operand`.\n. All of the patch modules in :doc:`/patches` have a ``.patch()`` method to\n   apply the patch again.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier` was split into\n   :func:`~mosql.util.identifier`, :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_as`, and\n   :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_dir`.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier` supports to use `pair` to include table\n   and column name; and\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_as` and :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_dir`\n   also supports to use `pair` to include alias or direction.\n. Renamed :exc:`~mosql.util.OptionError` to :exc:`~mosql.util.DirectionError`.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.delimit_identifier`,\n   :data:`~mosql.util.allowed_operators`, and\n   :data:`~mosql.util.allowed_directions` don't allow to disable anymore. Use\n   :class:`~mosql.util.raw` instead.\n. The deprecated modules in `/deprecated` will be removed in 0.11.\n. Refined all the documentation.\n\n",

This experimental functionality is currently\n  only enabled if  the ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER`` environment variable is set to\n  \"natural\". In the future, this behavior may become default, but only after\n  it has matured and seen substantial adoption. The ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER``\n  also accepts \"executable\" to force the default behavior of creating launcher\n  executables.\n* Issue 63: Bootstrap script (ez_setup.py) now prefers Powershell, curl, or\n  wget for retrieving the Setuptools tarball for improved security of the\n  install. The script will still fall back to a simple ``urlopen`` on\n  platforms that do not have these tools.\n* Issue 65: Deprecated the ``Features`` functionality.\n* Issue 52: In ``VerifyingHTTPSConn``, handle a tunnelled (proxied)\n  connection.\n\nBackward-Incompatible Changes\n=============================\n\nThis release includes a couple of backward-incompatible changes, but most if\nnot all users will find 1.0 a drop-in replacement for 0.9.\n\n* Issue 50: Normalized API of environment marker support. Specifically,\n  removed line number and filename from SyntaxErrors when returned from\n  `pkg_resources.invalid_marker`. Any clients depending on the specific\n  string representation of exceptions returned by that function may need to\n  be updated to account for this change.\n* Issue 50: SyntaxErrors generated by `pkg_resources.invalid_marker` are\n  normalized for cross-implementation consistency.\n* Removed ``--ignore-conflicts-at-my-risk`` and ``--delete-conflicting``\n  options to easy_install.

Note that this\n  change means that all of a namespace package's ``__init__.py`` files must\n  include a ``declare_namespace()`` call in order to ensure that they will be\n  handled properly at runtime. In 2.x it was possible to get away without\n  including the declaration, but only at the cost of forcing namespace\n  packages to be imported early, which 3.0 no longer does.\n* Issue 148: When building (bdist_egg), setuptools no longer adds\n  ``__init__.py`` files to namespace packages. Any packages that rely on this\n  behavior will need to create ``__init__.py`` files and include the\n  ``declare_namespace()``.\n* Issue 7: Setuptools itself is now distributed as a zip archive in addition to\n  tar archive. ez_setup.py now uses zip archive. This approach avoids the potential\n  security vulnerabilities presented by use of tar archives in ez_setup.py.\n  It also leverages the security features added to ZipFile.extract in Python 2.7.4.\n* Issue 65: Removed deprecated Features functionality.\n* BB Pull Request 28: Remove backport of ``_bytecode_filenames`` which is\n  available in Python 2.6 and later, but also has better compatibility with\n  Python 3 environments.\n* Issue 156: Fix spelling of __PYVENV_LAUNCHER__ variable.\n\n",

(Pull 724)\n\n* Fixed problem where re-installs always occurred when using file:// find-links.\n  (Pulls 683/702)\n\n* \"pip install -v\" now shows the full download url, not just the archive name.\n  Thanks Marc Abramowitz (Pull 687)\n\n* Fix to prevent unnecessary PyPI redirects. Thanks Alex Gronholm (Pull 695)\n\n* Fixed issue 670 - install failure under Python 3 when the same version\n  of a package is found under 2 different URLs.  Thanks Paul Moore (Pull 671)\n\n* Fix git submodule recursive updates.  Thanks Roey Berman. (Pulls 674)\n\n* Explicitly ignore rel='download' links while looking for html pages.\n  Thanks Maxime R. (Pull 677)\n\n* --user/--upgrade install options now work together. Thanks 'eevee' for\n  discovering the problem. (Pull 705)\n\n* Added check in ``install --download`` to prevent re-downloading if the target\n  file already exists. Thanks Andrey Bulgakov. (Pull 669)\n\n* Added support for bare paths (including relative paths) as argument to\n  `--find-links`. Thanks Paul Moore for draft patch.\n\n* Added support for --no-index in requirements files.\n\n* Added \"pip show\" command to get information about an installed package.\n  Fixes 131. Thanks Kelsey Hightower and Rafael Caricio.\n\n* Added `--root` option for \"pip install\" to specify root directory.

If the version\n  is 3.0 or 3.1 it uses the plone install recipe, otherwise it uses the Plone\n  egg from the cheeseshop.\n  [MatthewWilkes]\n\n* Link to appropriate PyPI pages for recipes used.\n  [MatthewWilkes]\n\n* Add a Zope 2 without Plone buildout template.\n  [evilbungle]\n\n* Reconciling HISTORY.txt to mirror what can be found at the following:\n  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZopeSkel/2.10. Release of 2.10 was clobbered\n  due to what looks like a merge at r74790.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Update plone2.5_template's buildout.cfg_tmpl to use Zope 2.9.10. This\n  release incorporates Hotfix-2008-08-12. Defaulting to a known insecure\n  Zope seems unwise for people that may be updating legacy environments into\n  buildout, since they're likely to forget to include the hotfix. Url to\n  2.9.10 hard-coded (as opposed to the more elegantly self-aware\n  plone.recipe.plone approach) per the practice of a plone.recipe.distros\n  plone part.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Nearly at the end of the creation of a ZopeSkel template, the local\n  commands available for that template are displayed.\n  [jaraco, markvl]\n\n* The Plone template now has local commands. (Basically moved them\n  from the archetype templates to plone templates and made them\n  available for both.\n  [markvl]\n\n* Added base test setup to the archetype template. Added wiring code that\n  runs README.txt as a doctest.\n  [esartor]\n\n* Added tests to the addcontent contenttype command. These ammend the\n  README.txt file for each content type providing basic tests for creating,\n  editing and removing instances of the added content type.\n  [esartor]\n\n\n",
