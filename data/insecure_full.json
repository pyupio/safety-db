This removes the httplib dependency for this module while fixing\n  some bugs related to redirects and SSL certs.\n* Fixed some bugs related to the incorrect creation of extra temp directories for\n  uploading files, which were not cleaned up properly.\n* Improved error reporting in certain situations, to provide more information such as\n  the playbook file/line.\n* Fixed a bug related to the variable precedence of role parameters, especially when\n  a role may be used both as a dependency of a role and directly by itself within the\n  same play.\n* Fixed some bugs in the 2.0 implementation of do/until.\n* Fixed some bugs related to run_once:\n  - Ensure that all hosts are marked as failed if a task marked as run_once fails.\n  - Show a warning when using the free strategy when a run_once task is encountered, as\n    there is no way for the free strategy to guarantee the task is not run more than once.\n* Fixed a bug where the assemble module was not honoring check mode in some situations.\n* Fixed a bug related to delegate_to, where we were incorrectly using variables from\n  the inventory host rather than the delegated-to host.\n* The 'package' meta-module now properly squashes items down to a single execution (as the\n  apt/yum/other package modules do).\n* Fixed a bug related to the ansible-galaxy CLI command dealing with paged results from\n  the Galaxy server.\n* Pipelining support is now available for the local and jail connection plugins, which is\n  useful for users who do not wish to have temp files/directories created when running\n  tasks with these connection types.\n* Improvements in support for additional shell types.\n* Improvements in the code which is used to calculate checksums for remote files.\n* Some speed ups and bug fixes related to the variable merging code.\n* Workaround bug in python subprocess on El Capitan that was making vault fail\n  when attempting to encrypt a file\n* Fix lxc_container module having predictable temp file names and setting file\n  permissions on the temporary file too leniently on a temporary file that was\n  executed as a script.

Now, a new ``get_credentials()`` method is called on the form to obtain\n    these credentials.\n  - The tests module now includes a ``no_lazysignup`` decorator that you can apply to a\n    method on your test case, which removes the lazy signup middleware for the duration\n    of that test only. This is useful for testing what happens when a view that is\n    marked with with the ``allow_lazy_user`` decorator ends up with an anonymous user\n    (most commonly, when a search engine visits).\n\nBackwards-incompatible changes:\n\n  - Generated usernames are now based on the session key, rather than actually being the\n    session key. This is to avoid a potential security issue where an app might simply\n    display a username, giving away a significant part of the user's session key. The\n    username is now generated from a SHA1 hash of the session key. This change means that\n    existing generated users will become invalid.\n\n",

    "gevent": [
        {
            "changelog": "==================\n\nIncompatible Changes\n--------------------\n- Support for Python 2.6 has been removed. See :pr:`766`.\n- Remove module ``gevent.coros`` which was replaced by ``gevent.lock``\n  and has been deprecated since 1.0b2.\n- The internal implementation modules ``gevent.corecext`` and\n  ``gevent.corecffi`` have been moved. Please import from\n  ``gevent.core`` instead.\n\nLibraries\n---------\n\n- Update libev to version 4.22.\n- Update tblib to 1.3.0.\n- Update c-ares to version 1.11.0 (`release notes\n  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-ares/c-ares/cares-1_11_0/RELEASE-NOTES>`_).\n- For the benefit of downstream package maintainers, gevent is now\n  tested with c-ares and libev linked dynamically and not embedded\n  (i.e., using the system libraries). However, only the versions\n  shipped with gevent are tested and known to work.\n- PyPy/CFFI: The corecffi native extension is now only built at\n  installation time. Previously, if it wasn't available, a build was\n  attempted at every import. This could lead to scattered \"gevent\"\n  directories and undependable results.\n- Update Cython to 0.24.\n- setuptools is now required at build time on all platforms.\n  Previously it was only required for Windows and PyPy.\n- POSIX: Don't hardcode ``/bin/sh`` into the configuration command\n  line, instead relying on ``sh`` being on the ``PATH``, as\n  recommended by `the standard <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html>`_.\n  Fixed in :pr:`809` by Fredrix Fornwall.\n\n\nSecurity\n--------\n- :mod:`gevent.pywsgi` now checks that the values passed to\n  ``start_response`` do not contain a carriage return or newline in\n  order to prevent HTTP response splitting (header injection), raising\n  a :exc:`ValueError` if they do. See :issue:`775`.\n- Incoming headers containing an underscore are no longer placed in\n  the WSGI environ. See :issue:`819`.\n- Errors logged by :class:`~gevent.pywsgi.WSGIHandler` no\n  longer print the entire WSGI environment by default. This avoids\n  possible information disclosure vulnerabilities. Applications can\n  also opt-in to a higher security level for the WSGI environment if they\n  choose and their frameworks support it. Originally reported\n  in :pr:`779` by sean-peters-au and changed in :pr:`781`.\n\n\nStdlib Compatibility\n--------------------\n- The modules :mod:`gevent.os`, :mod:`gevent.signal` and\n  :mod:`gevent.select` export all the attributes from their\n  corresponding standard library counterpart.\n- If :func:`gevent.select.select` is given a negative *timeout*\n  argument, raise an exception like the standard library does.\n- If :func:`gevent.select.select` is given closed or invalid\n  file descriptors in any of its lists, raise the appropriate\n  ``EBADF`` exception like the standard library does. Previously,\n  libev would tend to return the descriptor as ready. In the worst\n  case, this adds an extra system call, but may also reduce latency if\n  descriptors are ready at the time of entry.\n- :class:`selectors.SelectSelector` is properly monkey-patched\n  regardless of the order of imports. Reported in :issue:`835` by\n  Przemys\u0142aw W\u0119grzyn.\n- :meth:`gevent.select.poll.unregister` raises an exception if *fd* is not\n  registered, like the standard library.\n- :meth:`gevent.select.poll.poll` returns an event with\n  ``POLLNVAL`` for registered fds that are invalid. Previously it\n  would tend to report both read and write events.\n- Python 2: ``reload(site)`` no longer fails with a ``TypeError`` if\n  gevent has been imported. Reported in :issue:`805` by Jake Hilton.\n- Python 2: ``sendall`` on a non-blocking socket could spuriously fail\n  with a timeout.\n- ``FileObjectPosix`` exposes the ``read1`` method when in read mode,\n  and generally only exposes methods appropriate to the mode it is in.\n- ``FileObjectPosix`` supports a *bufsize* of 0 in binary write modes.\n  Reported in :issue:`840` by Mike Lang.\n- Python 3: meth:`gevent.socket.connect_ex` was letting\n  ``BlockingIOError`` (and possibly others) get raised instead of\n  returning the errno due to the refactoring of the exception\n  hierarchy in Python 3.3. Now the errno is returned. Reported in\n  :issue:`841` by Dana Powers.\n- Setting SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL after :mod:`gevent.subprocess`\n  had been used previously could not be reversed, causing\n  ``Popen.wait`` and other calls to hang. Now, if SIGCHLD has been\n  ignored, the next time :mod:`gevent.subprocess` is used this will be\n  detected and corrected automatically. (This potentially leads to\n  issues with :func:`os.popen` on Python 2, but the signal can always\n  be reset again. Mixing the low-level process handling calls,\n  low-level signal management and high-level use of\n  :mod:`gevent.subprocess` is tricky.) Reported in :issue:`857` by\n  Chris Utz.\n\nOther Changes\n-------------\n\n- :class:`~.Group` and :class:`~.Pool` now return whether\n  :meth:`~.Group.join` returned with an empty group. Suggested by Filippo Sironi in\n  :pr:`503`.\n- Servers: Default to AF_INET6 when binding to all addresses (e.g.,\n  \"\"). This supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connections (except on\n  Windows). Original change in :pr:`495` by Felix Kaiser.\n- Unhandled exception reports that kill a greenlet now include a\n  timestamp. See :issue:`137`.\n- Add :class:`gevent.threadpool.ThreadPoolExecutor` (a\n  :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` variant that always\n  uses native threads even when the system has been monkey-patched)\n  on platforms that have ``concurrent.futures``\n  available (Python 3 and Python 2 with the ``futures`` backport\n  installed). This is helpful for, e.g., grpc. Reported in\n  :issue:`786` by Markus Padourek.\n- Native threads created before monkey-patching threading can now be\n  joined. Previously on Python < 3.4, doing so would raise a\n  ``LoopExit`` error. Reported in :issue:`747` by Sergey Vasilyev.\n- pywsgi/performance: Chunks of data the application returns are no longer copied\n  before being sent to the socket when the transfer-encoding is\n  chunked, potentially reducing overhead for large responses.\n- :class:`~.PriorityQueue` now ensures that an initial items list is a\n  valid heap. Fixed in :pr:`793` by X.C.Dong.\n- On Python 2.7.9 and above (more generally, when the SSL backport is\n  present in Python 2), :func:`gevent.ssl.get_server_certificate`\n  would raise a :exc:`ValueError` if the system wasn't monkey-patched.\n  Reported in :issue:`801` by Gleb Dubovik.\n- On Python 2.7.9 and Python 3, closing an SSL socket in one greenlet\n  while it's being read from or written to in a different greenlet is\n  less likely to raise a :exc:`TypeError` instead of a\n  :exc:`ValueError`. Reported in :issue:`800` by Kevin Chen.\n- :class:`gevent.hub.signal` (aka :func:`gevent.signal`) now verifies\n  that its `handler` argument is callable, raising a :exc:`TypeError`\n  if it isn't. Reported in :issue:`818` by Peter Renstr\u00f6m.\n- If ``sys.stderr`` has been monkey-patched (not recommended),\n  exceptions that the hub reports aren't lost and can still be caught.\n  Reported in :issue:`825` by Jelle Smet.\n- The various ``FileObject`` implementations are more consistent with\n  each other.\n\n  .. note:: Writing to the *io* property of a FileObject should be\n            considered deprecated after it is constructed.\n\n",

Previously\n  these databases worked on little endian machines with libmaxminddb but did\n  not work on big endian machines. Due to increased safety checks when reading\n  the file, these databases will no longer work on any platform. If you are\n  using one of these databases, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest\n  GeoLite2 or GeoIP2 database\n* Added pkg-config support. If your system supports it, then running `make\n  install` now installs a `libmaxminddb.pc` file for pkgconfig. Implemented by\n  Jan Vcelak.\n* Several segmentation faults found with afl-fuzz were fixed. These were\n  caused by missing bounds checking and missing data type verification checks.\n* `MMDB_get_entry_data_list` will now fail on data structures with a depth\n  greater than 512 and data structures that are cyclic. This should not\n  affect any known MaxMind DB in production. All databases produced by\n  MaxMind have a depth of less than five.\n\n\n",

The standard :func:`~mosql.util.escape` and\n   :func:`~mosql.util.escape_identifier` now raise :exc:`ValueError` if its\n   argument has a null byte. A null byte may truncate the SQL when database\n   interprets it, but it still depends on how database handles it. Thanks\n   `Orange <http://blog.orange.tw>`_ for reporting this issue.\n. Removed the support to use subquery directly. Use the new\n   :func:`~mosql.util.subq` instead.\n\nAs far as we know, the two flaws can't be exploited, but we still strongly\nrecommend you to upgrade to this version.\n\nThis version, v0.10, re-passed the strictest (level=5, risk=3) sqlmap_ tests on both value and identitifer-side in the cases:\n\n- MySQL 5.6.21 with `MySQLdb <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/>`_\n  1.2.5\n- MySQL 5.6.21 with `MySQL Connector/Python\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-connector-python>`_ 2.0.2\n- PostgreSQL 9.3.5 with `Psycopg <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2>`_ 2.5.4\n\nThe Majoy Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n. The :class:`~mosql.db.Database` supports to keep connection open.\n. The :class:`~mosql.db.Database` is thread-safe now.\n. The :func:`~mosql.query.insert` supports multi-value.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.build_where` translates ``x IN ()`` into ``FALSE``.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.build_where` allows to use `pair` as key to include\n   operator.\n. The :class:`mosql.util.Statement.format` ignores false -- in bool context --\n   clause argument.\n. The :class:`mosql.util.Statement.format` raises :exc:`TypeError` if there is\n   any unused clause argument.\n. Added :meth:`mosql.util.Query.enable_echo` to echo the SQL it builds.\n\nCheck details in :class:`~mosql.db.Database` or :func:`~mosql.query.select`.\n\nThe Minor Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n. Added :func:`~mosql.util.dot`, :func:`~mosql.util.as_`,\n   :func:`~mosql.util.asc`, :func:`~mosql.util.desc`, :func:`~mosql.util.subq`,\n   and :func:`~mosql.util.in_operand`.\n. All of the patch modules in :doc:`/patches` have a ``.patch()`` method to\n   apply the patch again.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier` was split into\n   :func:`~mosql.util.identifier`, :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_as`, and\n   :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_dir`.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier` supports to use `pair` to include table\n   and column name; and\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_as` and :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_dir`\n   also supports to use `pair` to include alias or direction.\n. Renamed :exc:`~mosql.util.OptionError` to :exc:`~mosql.util.DirectionError`.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.delimit_identifier`,\n   :data:`~mosql.util.allowed_operators`, and\n   :data:`~mosql.util.allowed_directions` don't allow to disable anymore. Use\n   :class:`~mosql.util.raw` instead.\n. The deprecated modules in `/deprecated` will be removed in 0.11.\n. Refined all the documentation.\n\n",

This experimental functionality is currently\n  only enabled if  the ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER`` environment variable is set to\n  \"natural\". In the future, this behavior may become default, but only after\n  it has matured and seen substantial adoption. The ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER``\n  also accepts \"executable\" to force the default behavior of creating launcher\n  executables.\n* Issue 63: Bootstrap script (ez_setup.py) now prefers Powershell, curl, or\n  wget for retrieving the Setuptools tarball for improved security of the\n  install. The script will still fall back to a simple ``urlopen`` on\n  platforms that do not have these tools.\n* Issue 65: Deprecated the ``Features`` functionality.\n* Issue 52: In ``VerifyingHTTPSConn``, handle a tunnelled (proxied)\n  connection.\n\nBackward-Incompatible Changes\n=============================\n\nThis release includes a couple of backward-incompatible changes, but most if\nnot all users will find 1.0 a drop-in replacement for 0.9.\n\n* Issue 50: Normalized API of environment marker support. Specifically,\n  removed line number and filename from SyntaxErrors when returned from\n  `pkg_resources.invalid_marker`. Any clients depending on the specific\n  string representation of exceptions returned by that function may need to\n  be updated to account for this change.\n* Issue 50: SyntaxErrors generated by `pkg_resources.invalid_marker` are\n  normalized for cross-implementation consistency.\n* Removed ``--ignore-conflicts-at-my-risk`` and ``--delete-conflicting``\n  options to easy_install.

Note that this\n  change means that all of a namespace package's ``__init__.py`` files must\n  include a ``declare_namespace()`` call in order to ensure that they will be\n  handled properly at runtime. In 2.x it was possible to get away without\n  including the declaration, but only at the cost of forcing namespace\n  packages to be imported early, which 3.0 no longer does.\n* Issue 148: When building (bdist_egg), setuptools no longer adds\n  ``__init__.py`` files to namespace packages. Any packages that rely on this\n  behavior will need to create ``__init__.py`` files and include the\n  ``declare_namespace()``.\n* Issue 7: Setuptools itself is now distributed as a zip archive in addition to\n  tar archive. ez_setup.py now uses zip archive. This approach avoids the potential\n  security vulnerabilities presented by use of tar archives in ez_setup.py.\n  It also leverages the security features added to ZipFile.extract in Python 2.7.4.\n* Issue 65: Removed deprecated Features functionality.\n* BB Pull Request 28: Remove backport of ``_bytecode_filenames`` which is\n  available in Python 2.6 and later, but also has better compatibility with\n  Python 3 environments.\n* Issue 156: Fix spelling of __PYVENV_LAUNCHER__ variable.\n\n",

Thanks Rafael Caricio, Miguel Araujo, Dmitry Gladkov (Pull 752)\n\n* Fixed security issues with pip's use of temp build directories.\n  Thanks David (d1b) and Thomas Guttler. (Pull 780)\n\n* Improvements to sphinx docs and cli help. (Pull 773)\n\n* Fixed issue 707, dealing with OS X temp dir handling, which was causing\n  global NumPy installs to fail. (Pull 768)\n\n* Split help output into general vs command-specific option groups.\n  Thanks Georgi Valkov. (Pull 744; Pull 721 contains preceding refactor)\n\n* Fixed dependency resolution when installing from archives with uppercase\n  project names. (Pull 724)\n\n* Fixed problem where re-installs always occurred when using file:// find-links.\n  (Pulls 683/702)\n\n* \"pip install -v\" now shows the full download url, not just the archive name.\n  Thanks Marc Abramowitz (Pull 687)\n\n* Fix to prevent unnecessary PyPI redirects. Thanks Alex Gronholm (Pull 695)\n\n* Fixed issue 670 - install failure under Python 3 when the same version\n  of a package is found under 2 different URLs.  Thanks Paul Moore (Pull 671)\n\n* Fix git submodule recursive updates.  Thanks Roey Berman. (Pulls 674)\n\n* Explicitly ignore rel='download' links while looking for html pages.\n  Thanks Maxime R. (Pull 677)\n\n* --user/--upgrade install options now work together. Thanks 'eevee' for\n  discovering the problem. (Pull 705)\n\n* Added check in ``install --download`` to prevent re-downloading if the target\n  file already exists. Thanks Andrey Bulgakov. (Pull 669)\n\n* Added support for bare paths (including relative paths) as argument to\n  `--find-links`. Thanks Paul Moore for draft patch.\n\n* Added support for --no-index in requirements files.\n\n* Added \"pip show\" command to get information about an installed package.\n  Fixes 131. Thanks Kelsey Hightower and Rafael Caricio.\n\n* Added `--root` option for \"pip install\" to specify root directory. Behaves\n  like the same option in distutils but also plays nice with pip's egg-info.\n  Thanks Przemek Wrzos.  (Issue 253 / Pull 693)\n\n",

If the version\n  is 3.0 or 3.1 it uses the plone install recipe, otherwise it uses the Plone\n  egg from the cheeseshop.\n  [MatthewWilkes]\n\n* Link to appropriate PyPI pages for recipes used.\n  [MatthewWilkes]\n\n* Add a Zope 2 without Plone buildout template.\n  [evilbungle]\n\n* Reconciling HISTORY.txt to mirror what can be found at the following:\n  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZopeSkel/2.10. Release of 2.10 was clobbered\n  due to what looks like a merge at r74790.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Update plone2.5_template's buildout.cfg_tmpl to use Zope 2.9.10. This\n  release incorporates Hotfix-2008-08-12. Defaulting to a known insecure\n  Zope seems unwise for people that may be updating legacy environments into\n  buildout, since they're likely to forget to include the hotfix. Url to\n  2.9.10 hard-coded (as opposed to the more elegantly self-aware\n  plone.recipe.plone approach) per the practice of a plone.recipe.distros\n  plone part.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Nearly at the end of the creation of a ZopeSkel template, the local\n  commands available for that template are displayed.\n  [jaraco, markvl]\n\n* The Plone template now has local commands. (Basically moved them\n  from the archetype templates to plone templates and made them\n  available for both.\n  [markvl]\n\n* Added base test setup to the archetype template. Added wiring code that\n  runs README.txt as a doctest.\n  [esartor]\n\n* Added tests to the addcontent contenttype command. These ammend the\n  README.txt file for each content type providing basic tests for creating,\n  editing and removing instances of the added content type.\n  [esartor]\n\n\n",
