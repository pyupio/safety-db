This patch\n    appears to fix the problem.  Thanks to Kyle Mandli for helping with\n    debugging this issue and testing the fix\n\n14 Aug, 2009 (GV):\n  - BUG: Fix a bug when reseting the MlabTriangularMeshSource: when growing\n    the number of points, triangles were created before the corresponding\n    points. Thanks to Ondrej Certik for reporting this one\n\n08 Aug, 2009 (GV):\n  - BUG: Fix a bug for with the notebook in wx example for which objects were\n    not added to the right scene [24492]\n\n07 Aug, 2009 (Scott Warts):\n  - Added two more exceptions to state methods from ImageReslice:\n    SetOutputOriginToDefault and SetOutputExtentToDefault [24480]\n\n06 Aug, 2009 (PR):\n  - BUG: vtkImageReslice's SetOutputSpacingToDefault does not make\n    OutputSpacing a state method.

Also added `start_recording` and `stop_recording`\n    functions to mlab to make it easier to do this via scripts [24048]\n\n08 Jul, 2009 (GV):\n  - ENH: Make the MlabSceneModel manage the mlab current scene so that in\n    plots to the embedded scene, but does not upset the current\n    mlab figure [24040], [24065]\n\n05 Jul 2009 (GV):\n  - ENH: Add the possibility to specify figures to mlab.figure by instance\n    rather than name [24039]\n  - ENH: Add an example of using multiple mlab scene models [24041]\n  - ENH: Add a figure keyword argument to mlab.pipeline factories to\n    control which figure objects are added on [2403]\n\n02 July, 2009 (PR):\n  - ENH: The record icon on the engine view is smarter now and will\n    automatically be checked on and off if the engine's recorder trait in\n    set.  This paves the way for a convenient mlab one liner to start\n    recording [24025]\n\n01 Jul, 2009 (PR):\n  - NEW: Adding a new filter that clips an input dataset.  Also added an\n    `ImplicitWidgets` component that abstracts a box, plane, sphere and\n    implicit plane widget into one reusable component.  An  initial patch was\n    contributed by Suyog and them modified by PR.  Many thanks to Suyog for\n    this patch [24017]\n\n01 Jul, 2009 (GV):\n  - ENH: Add an mlab.close function to close figures controled by mlab\n    [24006]\n\n30 Jun, 2009 (PR):\n  - ENH/API: Checking in improved patch sent by Suyog along with fixes from me.\n    This adds a can_read_test metadata attribute for sources which can be\n    optionally specified, the function should return True if the reader can\n    read a given file.  The patch also adds a volume reader and a chaco\n    reader and also supports the .xyz format reader provided in VTK.  A test\n    for the new registry functionality is also added.  The API has only\n    changed for the manner in which the registry is queried for a reader\n    using the file itself rather than the file extension.  Many thanks to\n    Suyog for this work [24002]\n\n29 Jun, 2009 (GV):\n  - ENH: Add an option to show_engine to show the rich view [23981]\n\n14 Jun, 2009 (GV):\n  - BUG: mlab.set_engine was not registering engines, causing testing to\n    be difficult [23819]\n  - ENH: expose text3d in mlab [23820]\n  - ENH/TEST: rewamp the mlab testing infrastructure [23822]\n\n13 Jun, 2009 (GV):\n  - ENH: Adapt mlab.savefig code to make it easier to save figures with size\n    larger than window size [23813]\n  - ENH: Add a text3d module, for displaying text located in the 3D scene\n    scaling and hiding as the other 3D actors [23809], [23810].\n  - ENH: Add a helper function to mlab to syncronize cameras on two\n    scenes [23814]\n\n10 Jun, 2009 (PR):\n  - API: The name of the scene created on the mayavi2 app now defaults to\n    \"Mayavi Scene %d\" rather than \"TVTK Scene %d\".  This is to make this\n    consistent with what `mlab.figure()` does and to avoid user confusion\n    [23787]\n\n2 Jun, 2009 (PR):\n  - ENH: Ensuring that the scene editor's name is synced with the scene'\n    name.  Also making the scene itself \"renamable\" [23710]\n\n29 May, 2009 (PR):\n  - ENH: Also pickle the name of the scene -- it shouldn't hurt [23691]\n\n18 May, 2009 (GV):\n  - ENH: cleaner exception capture for sensible error message [23660]\n\n10 May, 2009 (GV):\n  - ENH: Use pickle rather than numpy npz for lookup table [23618]\n    [23619]\n  - API: Add PipelineBase to mayavi.core.api as it is needed for\n    the interactive example [23617]\n\n9 May, 2009 (PR):\n  - ENH/API: Adding to the API of the lut manager with a show_legend boo\n    which is an alias for show_scalar_bar.  This makes the UI a littl\n    clearer [23608]\n  - ENH: Adding ID's to the various pop-up editors for the lut manager s\n    their sizing etc. is persisted [23609]\n  - ENH/API: Exposing the scalar_bar_widget's representation in the UI an\n    API and recording it so changes to the scalar bar's position ar\n    recorded and editable on the UI [23610]\n\n\n20 Apr, 2009 (GV):\nENH [23545]:\n     - Add an example gallery to the documentation\n\n     - Rewamp the documentation-generation code, and its packaging. Th\n       generation code was made more robust, and as a result n\n       generated test files are checked in svn. The images for th\n       mlab documentation and the mlab examples are generated by th\n       render_images.py script\n     - Space has been optimized by removing duplicated artwork an\n       moving outside of the source distribution files no\n       required for distribution\n\n19 Apr, 2009 (GV)\n  - ENH: Use numpy's npz format for storing LUT information. This saves ~1Mo\n    from the source and binary distributions[23544]\n\n11 Apr, 2009 (GV):\n  - ENH/API: add an API module to core, to give a central place for\n    important core import [23520]\n\n\nFixes\n-----\n\n15 Jul, 2009 (PR):\n  - BUG: Fix what I think is a long standing bug.  You couldn't use the\n    envisage backend with mlab because of a problem with envisage'.\n    workbench application.  I've worked around the problem in mayavi'\n    workbench subclass and added a test to ensure that this is now fixed\n    This basically adds a new trait to the Mayavi app and the mayavi\n    workbench application called `start_gui_event_loop` that is disabled\n    when used from mlab [24171]\n\n6 Jul, 2009 (Dave Martin):\n  - BUG: If the scene being closed has None for scene.scene, call\n    registry.find_scene_engine(scene) instead of \"scene.scene\" [24052]\n    [24055]\n\n05 Jul, 2009 (GV):\n  - BUG: small fix for successive builds of the tvtk code generation, by\n    Rakesh Pandit [24038]\n  - BUG: Do not create application directories on import of mayavi\n    preferences. [24036]\n\n29 Jun, 2009 (GV):\n  - BUG: Make sure that the vertical vector source used for barchart is\n    well-behaved with regards to mlab_source.update [23983]\n\n28 Jun, 2009 (PR):\n  - BUG: Mlab's barchart uses the scale_by_vector_components which was not\n    exposed by the glyph component leading to update problems reported by\n    Christian Vollmer.  This is now fixed along with a simple test case.\n    There are deeper problems with barchart that do need attention though -\n    if a user changes the data inplace and calls the mlab_source.update()\n    nothing updates correctly since the data is really copied over to the\n    vector components.  This can be fixed with a callback and will be done\n    later. [23980]\n\n25 Jun, 2009 (PR):\n  - BUG: Was checking for attribute in editor assuming they were all scene\n    editors which is clearly wrong.  This bug fixes problems with using\n    mayavi and a text editor say [23933]\n\n2, Jun 2009 (PR):\n  - BUG: With recent versions of VTK when a VTK array is exported to a numpy\n    array, the numpy array is already a view so resetting the VTK array back\n    to the numpy array for some reason triggers a segfault.  This is now\n    fixed [23711]\n  - BUG: The Engine's open method did not work with a null engine.  Tested\n    and fixed [23713]\n\n30 May, 2009 (PR):\n  - [TVTK] BUG: Working around problem with parser for\n    vtkRenderedGraphRepresentation which has non-standard arguments for some\n    of its SetIvarToState methods [23696]\n\n26 Lay, 2009 (GV):\n  - BUG: Fix scaling bug for surf with warp_scale='auto'. Thanks to Jakob\n    Rohrhirsch for reporting it [23682]\n\n6 May, 2009 (PR):\n  - BUG: The implicit plane widget was not recordable [23595]\n  - BUG: [mlab] mlab.pipeline.contour_grid_plane was broken [23596]\n\n27 Apr, 2009 (GV):\n  - API: add an API module for core.ui [23562]\n  - DOC: Put up to date information on the engine [23560]\n\n23 Apr, 2009 (GV):\n  - DOC: Add an example to show how you can have different engines in an\n    application [23558]\n\n13 April, 2009 (PR):\n  - BUG: The trailing '|' in the wildcard breaks the file dialog's filterin\n    for user defined readers.  Thanks to B. P. Thrane for reporting the bug\n\n27 March, 2009 (GV):\n  - BUG: Fixed bug with importing customization contributions.  Added a test\n    case for this.  Thanks to Mario Ceresa for reporting the bug [23438]\n\n23 March, 2009 (GV):\n  - BUG: Fix TVTK possible build failure, reported by Andrew Straw\n    https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/34693 [23371]\n\n\n\n20 March, 2009 (PR):\n  - TEST/BUG: Adding a new test for the `tvtk.util.ctf` utility\n    functions.  Also fixed a bug that affects VTK-5.2 and above where the\n    range of the CTF must be set [23267]\n  - BUG/CLEAN: Fixing a 5.2 specific bug in the volume module mlab function\n    Also cleaned up the mlab code for this a little [23268]\n\n\nMayavi 3.2.0 (March 23, 2009)\n=============================\n\nA log of significant changes made to the package especially API changes.\nThis is only partial and only covers the developments after the 2.x\nseries.\n\n17, 18 March, 2009 (PR):\n    - NEW: A simple example to show how one can use TVTK's visual module\n      with mlab. [23250]\n    - BUG: The size trait was being overridden and was different from\n      the parent causing a bug with resizing the viewer. [23243]\n\n15 March, 2009 (GV):\n    - ENH: Add a volume factory to mlab that knows how to set color, vmin and\n      vmax for the volume module [23221].\n\n14 March, 2009 (PR):\n    - API/TEST: Added a new testing entry point: 'mayavi -t' now runs\n      tests in separate process, for isolation.  Added\n      ``mayavi.api.test`` to allow for simple testing from the\n      interpreter [23195]...[23200], [23213], [23214], [23223].\n    - BUG: The volume module was directly importing the\n      wx_gradient_editor leading to an import error when no wxPython is\n      available. This has been tested and fixed. Thanks to Christoph\n      Bohme for reporting this issue. [23191]\n\n14 March, 2009 (GV):\n    - BUG: [mlab]: fix positioning for titles [23194], and opacity for titles\n      and text [23193].\n    - ENH: Add the mlab_source attribute on all objects created by mlab,\n      when possible [23201], [23209].\n    - ENH: Add a message to help the first-time user, using the new banner\n      feature of the IPython shell view [23208].\n\n13 March, 2009 (PR):\n    - NEW/API: Adding a powerful TCP/UDP server for scripting mayavi via\n      the network. This is available in\n      ``mayavi.tools.server`` and is fully documented. It uses\n      twisted and currently only works with wxPython. It is completely\n      insecure though since it allows a remote user to do practically\n      *anything* from mayavi.\n\n13 March, 2009 (GV)\n    - API: rename mlab.orientationaxes to mlab.orientation_axes [23184]\n\n11 March, 2009 (GV)\n    - API: Expose 'traverse' in mlab.pipeline [23181]\n\n10 March, 2009 (PR)\n    - BUG: Fixed a subtle bug that affected the ImagePlaneWidget. This\n      happened because the scalar_type of the output data from the\n      VTKDataSource was not being set correctly. Getting the range of any\n      input scalars also seems to silence warnings from VTK. This should\n      hopefully fix issues with the use of the IPW with multiple scalars.\n      I've added two tests for this, one is an integration test since those\n      errors really show up only when the display is used. The other is a\n      traditional unittest. [23166]\n\n08 March, 2009 (GV)\n    - ENH: Raises an error when the user passes to mlab an array with\n      infinite values [23150]\n\n07 March, 2009 (PR)\n    - BUG: A subtle bug with a really gross error in the GridPlane\n      component, I was using the extents when I should really have been\n      looking at the dimensions. The extract grid filter was also not\n      flushing the data changes downstream leading to errors that are also\n      fixed now. These errors would manifest when you use an ExtractGrid to\n      select a VOI or a sample rate and then used a grid plane down stream\n      causing very wierd and incorrect rendering of the grid plane (thanks to\n      conflation of extents and dimensions). This bug was seen at NAL for a\n      while and also reported by Fred with a nice CME. The CME was then\n      converted to a nice unittest by Suyog and then improved. Thanks to\n      them all. [23146]\n\n28 February, 2009 (PR)\n    - BUG: Fixed some issues reported by Ondrej Certik regarding the use\n      Of mlab.options.offscreen, mlab.options.backend = 'test', removed cruft\n      from earlier 'null' backend, fixed bug with incorrect imports,\n      add_dataset set no longer adds one new null engine each time figure=False\n      is passed, added test case for the options.backend test. [23088]\n\n23 February, 2009 (PR)\n    - ENH: Updating show so that it supports a stop keyword argument that\n      pops up a little UI that lets the user stop the mainloop\n      temporarily and continue using Python [23049]\n\n21 February, 2009 (GV)\n    - ENH: Add a richer view for the pipeline to the MayaviScene [23035]\n    - ENH: Add safegards to capture wrong triangle array sizes in\n      mlab.triangular_mesh_source. [23037]\n\n21 February, 2009 (PR)\n    - ENH: Making the transform data filter recordable. [23033]\n    - NEW: A simple animator class to make it relatively to create\n      animations. [23036] [23039]\n\n20 February, 2009 (PR)\n    - ENH: Added readers for various image file formats, poly data\n      readers and unstructured grid readers. These include DICOM,\n      GESigna, DEM, MetaImage (mha,mhd) MINC, AVSucd, GAMBIT, Exodus, STL,\n      Points, Particle, PLY, PDB, SLC, OBJ, Facet and BYU files. Also added\n      several tests for most of this functionality along with small data files.\n      These are additions from PR's project staff, Suyog Jain and Sreekanth\n      Ravindran.  [23013]\n    - ENH: We now change the default so the ImagePlaneWidget does not\n      control the LUT. Also made the IPW recordable.
