This removes the httplib dependency for this module while fixing\n  some bugs related to redirects and SSL certs.\n* Fixed some bugs related to the incorrect creation of extra temp directories for\n  uploading files, which were not cleaned up properly.\n* Improved error reporting in certain situations, to provide more information such as\n  the playbook file/line.\n* Fixed a bug related to the variable precedence of role parameters, especially when\n  a role may be used both as a dependency of a role and directly by itself within the\n  same play.\n* Fixed some bugs in the 2.0 implementation of do/until.\n* Fixed some bugs related to run_once:\n  - Ensure that all hosts are marked as failed if a task marked as run_once fails.\n  - Show a warning when using the free strategy when a run_once task is encountered, as\n    there is no way for the free strategy to guarantee the task is not run more than once.\n* Fixed a bug where the assemble module was not honoring check mode in some situations.\n* Fixed a bug related to delegate_to, where we were incorrectly using variables from\n  the inventory host rather than the delegated-to host.\n* The 'package' meta-module now properly squashes items down to a single execution (as the\n  apt/yum/other package modules do).\n* Fixed a bug related to the ansible-galaxy CLI command dealing with paged results from\n  the Galaxy server.\n* Pipelining support is now available for the local and jail connection plugins, which is\n  useful for users who do not wish to have temp files/directories created when running\n  tasks with these connection types.\n* Improvements in support for additional shell types.\n* Improvements in the code which is used to calculate checksums for remote files.\n* Some speed ups and bug fixes related to the variable merging code.\n* Workaround bug in python subprocess on El Capitan that was making vault fail\n  when attempting to encrypt a file\n* Fix lxc_container module having predictable temp file names and setting file\n  permissions on the temporary file too leniently on a temporary file that was\n  executed as a script.  Addresses CVE-2016-3096\n* Fix a bug in the uri module where setting headers via module params that\n  start with HEADER_ were causing a traceback.\n* Fix bug in the free strategy that was causing it to synchronize its workers\n  after every task (making it a lot more like linear than it should have been).\n\n",

Now, a new ``get_credentials()`` method is called on the form to obtain\n    these credentials.\n  - The tests module now includes a ``no_lazysignup`` decorator that you can apply to a\n    method on your test case, which removes the lazy signup middleware for the duration\n    of that test only. This is useful for testing what happens when a view that is\n    marked with with the ``allow_lazy_user`` decorator ends up with an anonymous user\n    (most commonly, when a search engine visits).\n\nBackwards-incompatible changes:\n\n  - Generated usernames are now based on the session key, rather than actually being the\n    session key. This is to avoid a potential security issue where an app might simply\n    display a username, giving away a significant part of the user's session key.

Previously\n  these databases worked on little endian machines with libmaxminddb but did\n  not work on big endian machines. Due to increased safety checks when reading\n  the file, these databases will no longer work on any platform. If you are\n  using one of these databases, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest\n  GeoLite2 or GeoIP2 database\n* Added pkg-config support. If your system supports it, then running `make\n  install` now installs a `libmaxminddb.pc` file for pkgconfig. Implemented by\n  Jan Vcelak.\n* Several segmentation faults found with afl-fuzz were fixed. These were\n  caused by missing bounds checking and missing data type verification checks.\n* `MMDB_get_entry_data_list` will now fail on data structures with a depth\n  greater than 512 and data structures that are cyclic. This should not\n  affect any known MaxMind DB in production. All databases produced by\n  MaxMind have a depth of less than five.\n\n\n",

The standard :func:`~mosql.util.escape` and\n   :func:`~mosql.util.escape_identifier` now raise :exc:`ValueError` if its\n   argument has a null byte. A null byte may truncate the SQL when database\n   interprets it, but it still depends on how database handles it. Thanks\n   `Orange <http://blog.orange.tw>`_ for reporting this issue.\n. Removed the support to use subquery directly. Use the new\n   :func:`~mosql.util.subq` instead.\n\nAs far as we know, the two flaws can't be exploited, but we still strongly\nrecommend you to upgrade to this version.\n\nThis version, v0.10, re-passed the strictest (level=5, risk=3) sqlmap_ tests on both value and identitifer-side in the cases:\n\n- MySQL 5.6.21 with `MySQLdb <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/>`_\n  1.2.5\n- MySQL 5.6.21 with `MySQL Connector/Python\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-connector-python>`_ 2.0.2\n- PostgreSQL 9.3.5 with `Psycopg <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2>`_ 2.5.4\n\nThe Majoy Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n. The :class:`~mosql.db.Database` supports to keep connection open.\n. The :class:`~mosql.db.Database` is thread-safe now.\n. The :func:`~mosql.query.insert` supports multi-value.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.build_where` translates ``x IN ()`` into ``FALSE``.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.build_where` allows to use `pair` as key to include\n   operator.\n. The :class:`mosql.util.Statement.format` ignores false -- in bool context --\n   clause argument.\n. The :class:`mosql.util.Statement.format` raises :exc:`TypeError` if there is\n   any unused clause argument.\n. Added :meth:`mosql.util.Query.enable_echo` to echo the SQL it builds.\n\nCheck details in :class:`~mosql.db.Database` or :func:`~mosql.query.select`.\n\nThe Minor Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n. Added :func:`~mosql.util.dot`, :func:`~mosql.util.as_`,\n   :func:`~mosql.util.asc`, :func:`~mosql.util.desc`, :func:`~mosql.util.subq`,\n   and :func:`~mosql.util.in_operand`.\n. All of the patch modules in :doc:`/patches` have a ``.patch()`` method to\n   apply the patch again.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier` was split into\n   :func:`~mosql.util.identifier`, :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_as`, and\n   :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_dir`.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier` supports to use `pair` to include table\n   and column name; and\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_as` and :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_dir`\n   also supports to use `pair` to include alias or direction.\n. Renamed :exc:`~mosql.util.OptionError` to :exc:`~mosql.util.DirectionError`.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.delimit_identifier`,\n   :data:`~mosql.util.allowed_operators`, and\n   :data:`~mosql.util.allowed_directions` don't allow to disable anymore. Use\n   :class:`~mosql.util.raw` instead.\n. The deprecated modules in `/deprecated` will be removed in 0.11.\n. Refined all the documentation.\n\n",

This\n  blocks an attack detailed in glsa 200810-02; namely that an ebuild invoking\n  python -c (which looks in cwd for modules to load) allows for an attacker\n  to slip something in.\n\n\n-----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.11 (2008-10-10)\n-----------------------------\n\n- fix EAPI2 issues: default related primarily, invoke src_prepare for\n  >=EAPI2 instead of >EAPI2.\n\n\n-----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.10 (2008-10-07)\n-----------------------------\n\n- fix in setup.py to install eapi/* files.\n  die distutils, die.\n\n- api for depset inspection for tristate (pcheck visibility mode) is fixed\n  to not tell the consumer to lovingly 'die in a fire'.\n\n- correct a failure in EAPI=2 src_uri parsing complaining about\n  missing checksums for nonexistent files\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.9 (2008-10-06)\n----------------------------\n\n- eapi2 is now supported.\n\n- DepSet has grown a temp option named allow_src_uri_file_names; this\n  is to support eapi 2's -> SRC_URI extension.  This functionality\n  will under go refactoring in the coming days- as such the api addition\n  isn't considered stable.\n\n- we now match the forced phase ordering portage induced via breaking\n  eapi compatibilty for eapi0/1.\n\n- tightened up allowed atom syntax; repository dep is available only when\n  eapi is unspecified (no longer available in eapi2 in other words).\n  atom USE dep parsing now requires it to follow slotting- this is done to\n  match the other EAPI2 standard.\n\n  Beyond that, better error msgs and tighter validation.\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.8 (2008-08-28)\n----------------------------\n\n- pkgcore now properly preserves ownership of symlinks on merging.\n  ensure_perms plugins now need to handle symlinks (lchown at the least).\n\n- free resolver caches after resolution is finished; lower the memory\n  baseline for pmerge.\n\n- fix up interface definitions for >snakeoil-0.2 dependant_methods changes.\n  Via these cleanups and >snakeoil-0.2, memory usage is massively decreased\n  for pmerge invocations.\n\n- swallow EPIPE in pquery when stdout is closed early.\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.7 (2008-08-11)\n----------------------------\n\n- Disable fakeroot tests due to odd behaviour, and the fact it's currently\n  unused.\n\n- Fix installation issue for manpages for python2.4; os.path.join behaviour\n  differs between 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n- Kill off large memory leak that reared its head per pkg merge; still is\n  a bit of a leak remaining, but nothing near as bad as before.\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.6 (2008-08-10)\n----------------------------\n\n- fix sandbox complaint when PORT_LOGDIR is enabled- sandbox requires abspath\n  for any SANDBOX_WRITE exemptions, if PORT_LOGDIR path includes symlinks,\n  force a `readlink -f` of the sandbox exemption.\n  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-5176414.html\n\n- ticket 213; if stricter is in FEATURES, fail out if insecure rpath is\n  detected- otherwise, correct the entries.\n\n- ticket 207; drop the attempted known_keys/cache optimizations, instead\n  defer to parent's iterkeys always.  This eliminates the concurrency issue,\n  and simplifies staleness detection.  Also kills off a tb for --newuse .\n\n- ticket 201; pquery --restrict-revdep-pkgs wasn't behaving properly for\n  slot/repository/user atoms, now does.\n\n- Correct potential segfaults in cpython version of PackageRestriction and\n  StrExactMatch's __(eq|ne)__ implementations.\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.5 (2008-07-06)\n----------------------------\n\n- incremental_expansion and friends have grown a cpython implementation-\n  this speedup will show up if you are doing lots of profile work (pcheck\n  for example, which has to read effectively all profile).\n\n- if the invoking user isn't part of the portage group, don't throw a\n  traceback due to permission denied for virtuals cache.\n\n- correct a false positive in pkgcore.test.util.test_commandline that occurs\n  when snakeoil c extensions aren't enabled.\n\n- ticket 193; follow symlinks in /etc/portage/\\*/ directories.\n\n- ticket 203; functionfoo() {:;} is not function 'foo', it's 'functionfoo'.\n  Users shouldn't have seen this- thanks to ferdy for spotting it in an audit.\n\n- add 'skip_if_source' option to misc. binpkg merging triggers- defaults to\n  True, controls whether or not if a pkg from the target_repo should be\n  reinstalled to the repo.\n\n- make contentsSet.map_directory_structure go recursive-\n  this fixes ticket 204, invalid removal of files previously just merged.\n\n- make --newuse work with atoms/sets\n\n- add a cpy version of incremental_expansion\n\n- fix longstanding bug - finalize settings from make.conf, stopping negations\n  from being parsed twice. Without this fix, -* in a setting will negate\n  random flags set after it.\n\n- allow / in repo ids\n\n- don't show flags from previous versions of packages in --pretend output -\n  it's confusing and doesn't match portage behaviour.\n\n- fix ticket 192: ignore nonexistent files in config protect checking\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.4 (2008-06-11)\n----------------------------\n\n- eapi1 bug fix; check for, and execute if found, ./configure if ECONF_SOURCE\n  is unset.\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.3 (2008-05-16)\n----------------------------\n\n- ticket 185; tweak the test to give better debug info.\n\n- add proper handling of very, very large revision ints (up to 64 bits).\n\n- fakeroot tests are enabled again.\n\n- misc bug fixes; pquery --revdep traceback, vecho complaints from do*\n  scripts.\n\n- explicit notice that Jason Stubbs, Brian Harring, Andrew Gaffney, and\n  Charlie Shepherd, Zac Medico contributions are available under either\n  GPL2 (v2 only) or 3 clause BSD.\n  Terms are in root directory under files names BSD, and GPL2.\n  Aside from the bash bits Harring implemented during the EBD days, the\n  remaining ebuild bash bits are Gentoo Foundation copyright (GPL2), and\n  the contributions from Marien Zwart are currently GPL2 (config bits, still\n  need explicit confirmation).\n\n  What that effectively means is that pkgcore as a whole currently is GPL2-\n  sometime in the near future, the core of pkgcore (non-ebuild bits) will be\n  BSD/GPL2, and then down the line the bash bits will be rewritten to be\n  BSD/GPL2 (likely dropping the functionality it uses down to something bash/\n  BSD shell compatible).\n\n- expansion of -try/-scm awareness to installed pkgs database.  Binpkg\n  repositories now abid by ignore_paludis_versioning also.\n\n- ticket 184; silence disable debug-print in non build/install phases.\n\n- handle malformed rsync timestamps more cleanly.\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.2 (2008-05-07)\n----------------------------\n\n- new portage configuration feature- 'ignore-paludis-versioning'.  This\n  directs pkgcore to ignore nonstandard -scm ebuilds instead of complaining\n  about them.\n  Note this does *not* affect the installed pkgs database- if there is a\n  -scm ebuild in the vdb, pkgcore *must* deal with that ebuild, else if it\n  silently ignores vdb -scm pkgs it can result in overwriting parts of the\n  -scm pkg, and other weirdness.  If you've got a -scm version pkg installed,\n  it's strongly suggested you uninstall it unless you wish to be bound to that\n  nonstandard behaviour of paludis.\n\n  Finally, it's not yet covering *all* paludis version extensions- that will\n  be expanded in coming versions.\n\n- pkgcore is now aware of installed -scm pkgs, and gives a cleaner error\n  message.\n\n- a few versions of portage-2.2 automatically added PKGSET items to the\n  world file; due to how portage has implemented their sets, this would\n  effectively convert the data to portage only.  As such, that feature was\n  reversed (thank you genone); that said, a few world files have pkgset\n  entries from these versions.  Pkgcore now ignores it for worldfiles, and\n  levels a warning that it will clear the pkgset entry.\n\n- ticket 174; ignore bash style comments (leading ) in pkgsets, although\n  they're wiped on update.  If folks want them preserved, come up with a way\n  that preserves the location in relation to what the comment is about- else\n  wiping seems the best approach.\n\n- ticket 14; tweak PORT_LOGDIR support a bit, so that build, install,\n  and uninstall are seperated into different logs.\n\n- added '' operator to pmerge as an alias for --set; for example,\n  'pmerge system' is the same as 'pmerge --set system'.\n\n- fallback method of using the file binary instead of libmagic module is\n  fixed; ticket 183.\n\n\n----------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7.1 (2008-05-04)\n----------------------------\n\n- correct a flaw in repository searching that slipped past the test harness.\n  effectively breaks via inverting the negate logic for any complex search.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.7 (2008-05-03)\n--------------------------\n\n- prepstrip was updated to match current portage semantics, minus stripping\n  and splitdebug functionality (we handle that via a trigger).  Via this,\n  FEATURES=installsources and basic bincheck (pre-stripped binaries) is now\n  supported.\n\n- FEATURES='strip nostrip splitdebug' are now supported in portage\n  configuration (trigger is pkgcore.merge.triggers.BinaryDebug).\n\n- added cygwin ostype target for development purposes.  In no shape or form\n  is this currently considered supported, although anyone interested in\n  developing support for that platform, feel free to contact us.\n\n- in candidate identification in repository restriction matching, it was\n  possible for a PackageRestriction that was negated to be ignored, thus\n  resulting in no matches.  This has been corrected, although due to\n  collect_package_restrictions, it's possible to lose the negation state\n  leading to a similar scenario (no known cases of it currently).  This\n  codepath will need reworking to eliminate these scenarios.\n\n- mercurial+ sync prefix is now supported for hg.\n\n- triggers _priority class var is now priority; overload with a property if\n  custom functionality is needed.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.6 (2008-04-29)\n--------------------------\n\n- filelist sets (world file for example) are now sorted by atom comparison\n  rules.  ticket 178.\n\n- pquery --restrict-revdep-pkgs and --revdep-pkgs were added: they're\n  used to first match against possible pkgs, then do the revdep looking for\n  pkgs that revdep upon those specific versions.  Functionality may change,\n  as may the outputting of it.  ticket 179.\n\n- pebuild breakage introduced in 11/07 is corrected; back to working.\n\n- 'info' messages during merging are now displayed by default- new debug\n  message type was added that isn't displayed by default.\n\n- ebuild domain now accepts triggers configuration directive.\n\n- FEATURES=unmerge-buildpkg was added; this effectively quickpkgs a pkg\n  before it's unmerged so you have a snapshot of its last state before\n  it is replaced.\n\n- FEATURES=pristine-buildpkg was added; this is like FEATURES=buildpkg,\n  but tbzs the pkg prior to any modification by triggers.  Upshot of this,\n  you basically have an unmodified binpkg that can be localized to the merging\n  host rather then to the builder.  Simple example, with this if your main\n  system is FEATURES=strip, it tucks away a nonstripped binpkg- so that\n  consumers of the binary repo are able to have debug symbols if they want\n  them.\n\n- FEATURES=buildsyspkg is now supported.\n\n- FEATURES=buildpkg is now supported.\n\n- the engine used for install/uninstall/replace is now configurable via\n  engine_kls attribute on the op class.\n\n- dropped exporting of USER='portage' if id is portage.  Ancient var setting,\n  can't find anything reliant on it thus punting it.\n\n- add SunOS to known OS's since its lchown suffices for our needs.\n\n- added eapi awareness to atoms, so that an eapi1 atom only allows the\n  slot extension for example.\n\n- remove a stray printf from cpy atom; visible only when repository atoms\n  are in use.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.5 (2008-04-09)\n--------------------------\n\n- fix collision unprotect trigger exceptions (typically KeyError).\n  ticket 165\n\n- correct invalid passing of force keyword down when the repository isn't\n  frozen.  Occasionally triggered user visible tracebacks in pmaint copy.\n\n- portage broke compatibility with pkgcore a while back for our binpkgs-\n  for some inane reason, portage requires CATEGORY and PF in the xpak\n  segment.  This is being removed from portage in 2.2, but in the interim\n  pkgcore now forces those keys into the binpkgs xpak for compatibility\n  with portage.\n\n  Shorter version: pmaint copy generated binpkgs work with portage again.\n\n- cbuild/chost/ctarget are available via pquery --attr, and are written to\n  binpkg/vdb now.\n\n- stat removal work: FEATURES=-metadata-cache reuses existing eclass cache\n  object, thus one (and only one) scan of ${PORTDIR}/eclass\n\n- metadata, flat_hash, and paludis_flat_list cache formats configuration\n  arg 'label' is no longer required, and will be removed in 0.5.  If they're\n  unspecified, pkgcore will use location as the place to write the cache at,\n  else it'll combine location and label.\n\n- cdb, anydbm, sqlite, and sql_template cache backends have been removed\n  pending updating the code for cache backend cleanups.  If interested in\n  these backends, contact ferringb at irc://freenode.net/pkgcore .\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.4 (2008-04-06)\n--------------------------\n\n- merging/replacing performance may be a bit slower in this release- the level\n  of stats calls went up in comparison to previous releases, with several\n  duplicates.  This will be corrected in the next release- releasing in the\n  interim for bugfixes this version contains.\n\n- add CBUILD=${CBUILD:-${CHOST}}; couple of odd ebuilds rely on it despite\n  being outside of PMS.\n\n- protective trigger was added blocking unmerging of a basic set of\n  directories/syms; mainly /*, and /usr/*.\n\n- when a merge passes through a symlink for path resolution, that sym is\n  no longer pulled in as an entry of that pkg.  Originally this was done for\n  protective reasons, but it serves long term as a way to inadvertantly hold\n  onto undesired junk from the users fs, and opens the potential to unmerge\n  system/global symlinks when that pkg/slot's refcount hits zero.\n\n- detection, and predicting merge locations for syms was doing an unecessary\n  level of stat calls; this has been reduced to bare minimum.\n\n- ticket 159; force an realpath of CONTENTS coming from the vdb due to other\n  managers not always writing realpath'd entries, thus resulting in occasional\n  misidentification of what to remove.\n\n- pkgcore.util.parserestrict no longer throws MalformedAtom, always\n  ParseError.  Removes ugly commandline tracebacks for bad atoms supplied\n  to pmerge.\n\n- ticket 158; honor RSYNC_PROXY for rsync syncer.\n  Thanks to user Ford_Prefect.\n\n- pmerge -N now implies --oneshot.\n\n- correct a flaw in tbz2 merging where it repeatedly try to seek in the bz2\n  stream to generate chksums, instead of using the on disk files for\n  chksumming.\n\n- pmaint regen w/ > 1 thread no longer throws an ugly set of tracebacks upon\n  completion.\n\n- binpkg repositories now tell you the offending mode, and what is needed\n  to correct it.  No longer cares if the specified binpkg base location is\n  a symlink also.\n\n- pmaint --help usage descriptions are far more useful now.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.3 (2008-03-31)\n--------------------------\n\n- correct a corner case where a users bash_profile is noisy, specifically\n  disable using $HOME/.bashrc from all spawn_bash calls.\n\n- USE=-* in make.conf support is restored.  ticket 155.\n\n- minor tweak to package.keywords, package.use, and package.license support-\n  -* is properly supported now.  Following portage, if you're trying to\n  match keywords for a pkg that are '-* x86', you must match on x86.\n\n- pquery --attr use output for EAPI=1 default IUSE is significantly less\n  ugly.\n\n- ticket 150. EAPI1 IUSE defaults fixups.  stacking order is that default\n  IUSE is basically first in the chain, so any configuration (global, per\n  pkg, etc), will override if possible.  Effectively, this means a default\n  IUSE of \"-foon\" is pointless, since there is no earlier USE stack to\n  override.\n\n- pkgcore.ebuild.collapsed_restrict_to_data api was broken outside of a\n  major version bump- specifically pull_cp_data method was removed since\n  the lone consumer (pkgcore internals) doesn't need it, and the method\n  is semi dangerous to use since it only examines atoms.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.2 (2008-03-30)\n--------------------------\n\n- correct handling of ebuilds with explicit -r0 in filename, despite it being\n  implicit.  Thanks to rbrown for violating gentoo-x86 policy out of the blue\n  w/ an ebuild that has -r0 explicit in the filename for smoking out a bug\n  in pkgcore handling of it.  Ebuild since removed, but the KeyError issue\n  is corrected.  (keep the bugs coming)\n\n- minor performance optimization to binpkg merging when there is a large \n  of symlink rewrites required.\n\n- ticket 153; restore <0.4 behaviour for temporal blocker validation, rather\n  then invalidly relying on the initial vdb state for blocker checks.  Fixes\n  resolution/merging of sys-libs/pam-0.99.10.0\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.4.1 (2008-03-20)\n--------------------------\n\n- add tar contentsSet rewriting; tarballs sometimes leave out directories,\n  and don't always have the fully resolved path- /usr/lib/blah, when\n  /usr/lib -> /usr/lib64 *should* be /usr/lib64/blah, but tar doesn't force\n  this.  Due to that, can lead to explosions in unpacking- this is now fixed.\n\n- pquery --attr inherited was added; this feature may disappear down the\n  line, adding it meanwhile since it's useful for ebuild devs.\n\n- adjust setup.py so that man page installation properly respects --root\n\n- correct a corner case where a package name of 'dev-3D' was flagged as\n  invalid.\n\n\n------------------------\npkgcore 0.4 (2008-03-18)\n------------------------\n\n- resolver fixes: vdb loadup wasn't occuring for old style virtuals for\n  rdepend blockers, now forces it.  It was possible for a node to be\n  considered usable before its rdepends blockers were leveled- now those\n  must be satisfied before being able to dep on the node.\n\n- resolver events cleanup; pmerge now gives far better info as to why a\n  choice failed, what it attempted to get around it, etc.\n\n- multiplex trees now discern their frozen state from their subtrees,\n  and will execute the repo_op for the leftmost subtree if unfrozen.\n\n- pquery --attr eapi was added.\n\n- ticket 94; package.provided is now supported fully both in profiles,\n  and in user profile (/etc/portage/profile).\n\n- ticket 116; ignore empty tarfile exception if the exception explicitly\n  states empty header.\n\n- utter corner case compatibility- =dev-util/diffball-1.0-r0 is now the\n  same as =dev-util/diffball-1.0 .\n\n- convert FETCHCOMMAND/RESUMECOMMAND support to execute spawn_bash by\n  default instead of trying to cut out shell; this kills off the occasional\n  incompatibility introduced via portage supplying make.globals.\n\n- FEATURES=sfperms is now a trigger instead of a dyn_preinst hook.\n  Faster, cleaner, etc.\n\n- delayed unpacking of binpkgs has been disabled; occasionally can lead to\n  quadratic behaviour in contents accessing, and extreme corner case trigger\n  breakages.  Will be re-enabled once API has been refactored to remove\n  these issues.\n\n- FEATURES=multilib-strict was converted into a trigger.  Tries to\n  use the python bindings for file first (merge file[python]), falling\n  back to invoking file.  Strongly suggested you have the bindings- fair bit\n  faster.  Finally, verification now runs for binpkgs also.\n\n- bug 137; symlink on directory merging failures where pkgcore would wipe\n  files it had just installed invalidly.\n\n- correct issue in offset rewriting (was resetting new_offset to '/')-\n  should only be api visible, no existing consumers known.\n\n- ebuild env lzma unpack support was broken; fixed (ticket 140).\n\n- Additional debug output for pmerge.\n\n- Further extending PortageFormatter to sanely handle worldfile highlights\n  and show repos with both id and location\n\n- Ticket 132: Portage Formatter supports real portage colors now,\n  thanks to agaffney for getting the ball rolling\n\n- Masked IUSEs were not treated right in all cases, thanks to agaffney\n  for report and help testing\n\n- diefunc tracebacks beautified\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.3.4 (2007-12-26)\n--------------------------\n\n- IUSEs were filtered, unstated were not respected though breaks with\n  current portage tree, so re-enabling.\n  Also sanely handle -flag enforcing now and kill hackish code for it.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.3.3 (2007-12-14)\n--------------------------\n\n- IUSE defaults are respected now, so EAPI=1 implemented\n\n- Write slotted atoms to worldfile as portage supports this now\n\n- Sync up with portage; add support for lzma to unpack- mirror r7991 from\n  portage.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.3.2 (2007-11-03)\n--------------------------\n\n- ticket 190746 from gentoo; basically need to force the perms of first level\n  directory of an unpacked $DISTDIR to ensure it's at least readable/writable.\n  fixes unpacking of app-misc/screen-4.0.3_p20070403::gentoo-x86 .\n\n- ticket 118; if -u, don't add the node to world set.\n\n- correct a corner case in python implementation of cpv comparison (just\n  python, cpy extension handles it correctly); bug 188449 in gentoo, basically\n  floats have a limited precision, thus it was possible to get truncation in\n  comparison with specially crafted versions.\n\n- handle EOF/IOError on raw_input (for --ask) a bit more gracefully, ticket\n  108.\n\n- cd to ${WORKDIR} if ${S} doesn't exist for test/install phases; matches\n  change in portage behaviour.\n\n- Now require snakeoil version 0.2 and up- require new capability of\n  AtomicWriteFile, ability to specify uid/gid/perms.  Via that, fixes ticket\n  109 (umask leaking through to profile.env).\n\n- the 'glsa' pkgset is now deprecated in favor of 'vuln'; will remain\n  through till 0.4 (ticket 106).\n\n- ticket 105/96; fix via andkit, basically a bug in einstall lead to\n  extra einstall opts getting dropped instead of passed through.\n\n- compatibility fix for lha unpacking for nwere versions of lha.\n\n- emake now invokes ${MAKE:-make}, instead of make- undocumented ebuild\n  req, see bug 186598 at bugs.gentoo.org.\n\n- pmerge --verbose is now pmerge -F portage-verbose-formatter\n\n- Stop installing pregen symlink; functionality moved to pmaint regen.\n\n- 'pmerge --domain' was added; basically is a way to specify the domain to\n  use, else usees the configuration defined default domain.\n\n- new ebuild trigger to avoid installing files into symlinked dir (get_libdir\n  is the friend to fix a common /usr/lib -> /usr/lib64 bug), ticket 119\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.3.1 (2007-06-27)\n--------------------------\n\n- ticket 86; export FILE for portage_conf FETCHCOMMAND/RESUMECOMMAND support,\n  convert from spawn_bash to spawn, add some extra error detection\n\n- Correct cleanup of unknown state ebp processors; basically discard them if\n  they fail in any way.  Cleanup inherit error msg when under ebd.\n\n- Correct permission issue for vdb virtuals cache.\n\n- ticket 84; rework overlay internals so that sorting order can't accidentally\n  expose a version masked by a higher priority repository in an overlay stack.\n\n\n------------------------\npkgcore 0.3 (2007-06-06)\n------------------------\n\n- pregen has moved into pmaint regen.\n\n- Several example scripts that show how to use the pkgcore api have been\n  added, among others:\n  - repo_list (lists repos and some of their attributes)\n  - changed_use (a poor man's --newuse)\n  - pkg_info (show maintainers and herds of a package)\n  - pclean (finds unused distfiles)\n\n- Pkgcore now supports several different output formats for the buildplan.\n  Portage and Paludis emulation are the notable formats, though plan\n  category/package and the original output are also available as options.\n\n- Portage formatter is now the default.\n\n- Pkgcore formatter (no longer default) output was simplified to be less\n  noisy.\n\n- Large grammar fixes for documentation.\n\n- Miscellaneous pylint cleanups, including whitespace fixes.\n\n- Most of pkgcore.util.* (mainly the non pkgcore-specific bits) have been\n  split out into a separate package, snakeoil. This includes the relevant cpy\n  extensions.\n\n- Triggers are quieter about what they're doing by default.\n\n- /etc/portage/package.* can now contain unlimited subdirectories and\n  files (ticket 71).\n\n- livefs functionality is no longer accessible in pkgcore.fs.*; have to access\n  pkgcore.fs.livefs.*\n\n- old style virtual providers from the vdb are now preferred for newer versions\n  over profile defined defaults.\n\n- added profile package.use support.\n\n- ticket 80; $REPO_LOC/profiles/categories awareness; if the file exists, the\n  repo uses it by default.\n\n- resolver refactoring; report any regressions to ferringb.  Integrated in\n  events tracking, so that the choices/events explaining the path the resolver\n  took are recorded- via this, we actually have sane \"resolution failed due to\"\n  messages, adding emerge -pt/paludis --show-reasons is doable without hacking\n  the resolver directly, spotting which pkgs need to be unmasked/keyworded for\n  a specific request to be satisfied, etc, all of it is doable without having\n  to insert code directly into the resolver.  Anyone interested in adding these\n  featues, please talk to harring.\n  Worth noting, the events api and data structs for the resolver are still a\n  work in process- meaning the api is not guaranteed to stay stable at least\n  till the next minor release.\n\n- old style virtual pkgs are no longer combined into one with multiple\n  providers; aside from simplifying things, this fixes a few annoying resolution\n  failures involving virtual/modutils.\n\n\n---------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.14 (2007-04-08)\n---------------------------\n\n- correct potential for profile path calculation screwup.\n\n- refactor isolated-functions.sh so all internal vars are prefixed with\n  PKGCORE_RC\\_; shift vars filter to PKGCORE_RC\\_.* instead of RC\\_.* .\n  If you were having problems building courier-imap (RC_VER variable),\n  this fixes it.\n\n- better interop with paludis VDB environment dumps.\n\n- treat RESTRICT as a straight depset for UI purposes (minor, but looks\n  better this way).\n\n\n---------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.13 (2007-03-30)\n---------------------------\n\n- Added '~' to allowed shlex word chars.\n\n- Due to amd64 /lib -> /lib64, change the default policy for sym over\n  directory merging to allow it if the target was a directory.\n\n\n---------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.12 (2007-03-29)\n---------------------------\n\n- Ensure PackageRestriction._handle_exceptions filters the check down to\n  just strings; if running pure python, this could trigger a traceback\n  via the python native native_CPV.__cmp__.\n\n- Tweak python native native_CPV.__cmp__ to not explode if given an instance\n  that's not a CPV derivative.\n\n- Reorder ||() to use anything matched via the current state graph, aside\n  from normal reordering to prefer vdb.\n\n- default mode for ensure_dirs is now 0755.\n\n- Work around broken java-utils-2.eclass state handling in\n  java-pkg_init_paths\\_; tries to access DESTTREE in setup phase, which\n  shouldn't be allowed- fix is temporarily shifting the DESTTREE definition\n  to pre-ebuild sourcing so that it behaves.\n\n  Will be removed as soon as the eclass behaves is fixed.\n\n\n---------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.11 (2007-03-27)\n---------------------------\n\n- COLON_SEPARATED, not COLON_SEPERATED for env.d parsing.\n\n- fix ticket 74; \"x=ya\" should parse out as 'ya', was terminating\n  early.\n\n\n---------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.10 (2007-03-27)\n---------------------------\n\n- FEATURES=ccache now corrects perms as needed for when userpriv toggles.\n\n- shift PORTAGE_ACTUAL_DISTDIR and DISTDIR definition into the initial env,\n  so that evil git/subversion/cvs class can get at it globally.\n\n- pquery --attr repo now returns the repo_id if it can get it, instead of\n  the str of the repo object.\n\n- OR grouppings in PROVIDES was explicitly disabled; no ebuild uses it, nor\n  should any.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.9 (2007-03-19)\n--------------------------\n\n- convert use.mask/package.use.mask, use.force/package.use.force stacking\n  to match portage behaviour- basically stack use.* and package.* per profile\n  node rather then going incremental for use.*, then package.* .  If you were\n  having issues with default-linux/amd64/2006.1 profile and sse/sse2 flags for\n  mplayer, this ought to correct it.\n\n- add USE conditional support to RESTRICT.\n\n- fix noisy regression from 0.2.8 for temp declare overriding; if you saw lots\n  of complaints on env restoration, corrects it.  Superficial bug, but rather\n  noisy.\n\n- Fix a bug for binpkg creation where PROVIDES gets duplicated.\n\n- Bit more DepSet optimizations; specifically collapses AND restriction into\n  the parent if it is also an AND restriction.\n\n- make --no-auto work correctly for pebuild\n\n- delay DISTDIR setup till unpack phase to prevent any invalid access; also\n  takes care of a pebuild traceback.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.8 (2007-03-17)\n--------------------------\n\n- fix bug so that 6_alpha == 6_alpha0 when native_CPV is in use; only possible\n  way to have hit the bug is having all extensions disabled (CPY version gets it\n  right).\n\n- add a trigger to rewrite symlink targets if they point into ${D}\n\n- info trigger now ignores any file starting with '.'; no more complaints about\n  .keep in info dirs.\n\n- if an ebuild has a non-default preinst and offset merging, a rescan of ${D}\n  is required- offset wasn't being injected, fixed.\n\n- if offset merging for a binpkg, reuse the original contentsSet class-\n  this prevents quadratic (worst case) seeking of the tarball via preserving\n  the ordering.\n\n- if merging a binpkg and a forced decompression is needed, update the\n  cset in memory instead of forcing a scan of ${D}.\n\n- misc filter-env fixes, cleanup, and tests.\n\n- change var attr (exported/readonly) env storage to better interop with\n  the others; internally, we still delay the var attr/shopt resetting till\n  execution.\n\n- misc initialization fixes to syncers for when invoked via GenericSyncer.\n  If previously layman integration wasn't working for you, should now.\n\n- shift the misc fs property triggers to pre_merge, rather then sanity_check;\n  sanity_check should be only for \"do I have what I need to even do the merge?\"\n  and minimal setup for the op (for example, transfering files into workdir).\n  Running preinst was occasionally wiping the changes the triggers made, thus\n  allowing screwed up ebuilds with custom preinst's to slip in a portage gid\n  for merge.\n\n- fix a corner case for cpy join spotted by TFKyle where length calculation\n  was incorrect, leading to a trailing null slipping into the calculated\n  path.\n\n- fix bash parsing for a corner case for empty assigns; literally,\n  x=\n  foo='dar'\n  would incorrectly interpret x=foo, instead of x=''.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.7 (2007-03-04)\n--------------------------\n\n- layman configuration (if available) is now read for portage configuration\n  for sync URI for overlays.  tar syncer is currently unsupported; others may\n  be buggy.  Feed back desired (author doesn't use layman).  Ticket 11.  If\n  you want it disabled, add FEATURES=-layman-sync .\n\n- another fix for daft tarballs that try to touch cwd.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.6 (2007-03-04)\n--------------------------\n\n- make intersecting ~ and =* atoms work again (used by pquery --revdep)\n\n- catch a corner case py2.5 bug where AttributeError bleeds through from\n  generic_equality.\n\n- Via solars prodding, finished up the remaining bits for ROOT support.\n\n- resolver traceback for if a requested atom is already known as insoluable.\n  Thanks to kojiro for spotting it.\n\n- misc bash code cleanup.\n\n- PATH protection has been loosened slightly to enable 'weird' eclasses that\n  are doing global PATH mangling.\n\n- $HOME location for building was shifted into the targeted packages\n  directory, rather then a shared within $PORTAGE_TMPDIR.\n\n- setgid/setuid triggers now match portage behaviour; -s,o-w mode change.\n\n- trigger warnings are now enabled.\n\n- New default trigger added; CommonDirectoryModes, checks for common\n  directories (/usr, /etc, /usr/bin, /usr/lib for example) in the merge set,\n  checking the packages specified modes for them.  If not 0755, throws a\n  warning.\n\n- For directory on directory merging, ensure_perms (default op) was changed\n  to preserve the existing directories permissions.  Generally speaking, this\n  means that later versions of an ebuild have to use post_inst to correct the\n  perms if they're incorrect- previously, the new perms/mode were forced on\n  the existing.  Several common ebuilds (openssl for example) will generate\n  weird modes on common directories however (heavily restricted perms), which\n  can break things.  For the time being, the default is scaled down to the\n  looser form portage does.\n\n- added man page generation: pquery, pmerge\n\n- pconfig now has a \"dump-uncollapsed\" command to dump the \"raw\" config.\n\n- pebuild now supports --no-auto to run just the targeted phase.\n\n- mass expansion of test coverage: pkgcore.restrictions.*,\n  pkgcore.util.*, pkgcore.ebuild.*\n\n- minor cleanup of pkgcore.test.ebuild.test_cpv to reduce redundant data sets;\n  total testcase runtime reduction by about a third.\n\n- diverge from unittest.TestCase to provide extra checks for normal asserts-\n  assertNotEqual for example, checks both __eq__ and __ne__ now to smoke out\n  any potential oversights in object equality implementation.\n\n- use nsec mtime resolution if available to match python stdlib.\n\n- env var PORTAGE_DEBUG for controlling how much debug info the ebuild env\n  generates is now PKGCORE_DEBUG; range is the same, 0 (none), 1 (just the\n  ebuild/eclass), 2 (1 + relevant setup code), 3 (2 + filter-env data),\n  4 (everything).\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.5 (2007-02-19)\n--------------------------\n\n- handle corner case in depend cycle processing where a package directly\n  depends upon itself; fixes processing of sys-devel/libtool specifically.\n\n- for pquery --attr keywords, sort by arch, not by stable/unstable.\n\n- correct misc corner case atom bugs; an intersection bug, miss on an invalid\n  use dep atom lacking a closure in cpy atom, verification of use chars in\n  native atom,\n\n- osutils extensions tests, correcting a few cpy differences in behaviour from\n  native.\n\n- For unpacking a tarball that doesn't have its files in a subdir, tar will\n  occasionally try to utime the cwd resulting in a failure- uid owner for\n  WORKDIR was changed to allow tar to do the utime, thus succeed in unpacking.\n  Only visible for userpriv and with oddball packages, gnuconfig for example.\n\n- Cleanup of a few slow test cases; running the test suite should now be around\n  25%-33% faster.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.4 (2007-02-16)\n--------------------------\n\n- refactoring of trigger implementations- cleanup and tests.  Additionally,\n  eliminate a potential mtime based frace if the underlying fs (or python\n  version) doesn't do subsecond resolution.\n\n- force FEATURES into the exported ebuild env always.\n\n- for pmerge -p $target, which prefers reuse normally, *still* prefer the\n  highest versions, just examine vdb first, then nonvdb.\n\n- minor optimization in readlines usage in the backend; kills off a duplicate\n  stat call.\n\n- if a stale cache entry is detected, and the backend is writable, wipe the\n  cache entry.  Little bit slower when detected, but saves parsing the file\n  next time around.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.3 (2007-02-12)\n--------------------------\n\n- support for ** in package.keywords\n\n- export preparsed SLOT to ebuild env; ebuilds shouldn't rely on this\n  since it can lead to fun metadata issues, but certain eclasses do.\n\n- fix exporting finalized form of RESTRICT to the build env; ticket 61.\n\n- fix for RESTRICT=fetch to not treat the filename as a uri.\n\n- expose the full make.conf environment to FETCHCOMMAND and RESUMECOMMAND-\n  ticket 58\n\n- added support for make.conf defined FETCH_ATTEMPTS; max  of unique uris to\n  attempts per file before giving up, defaults to 10.\n\n- added int_parser type for config instantiation definitions (ConfigHint),\n  and usual introspection support.\n\n- fix regression limiting satisifiers for depends to installed only in corner\n  case installed bound cycles; automake/perl specifically trigger this, thus\n  most folks should have seen it if using -B.\n\n- Better handling of non-ascii characters in metadata.xml.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.2 (2007-01-30)\n--------------------------\n\n- The terminfo db is now used for xterm title updates. If title updates\n  worked in pkgcore 0.2 or 0.2.1 and no longer work in 0.2.2 file a bug and\n  include the TERM environment variable setting.\n\n- misc fixup for asserts in cpy code when debugging is enabled, and closing\n  directory fds when corner case error paths are taken (out of memory for\n  example).\n\n- atoms are picklable now.\n\n- add tests for pmaint copy (quickpkg equivalent), and add\n  --ignore-existing option to copy just pkgs that don't exist in the\n  target repo.\n\n- fix pmerge handling of --clean -B for automake and a few other DEPEND level\n  hard cycles.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.2.1 (2007-01-24)\n--------------------------\n\n- fix corner case for portage configuration support; old system (<=2004)\n  installations may have /etc/portage/sets/world, which confused pmerges\n  world updating, leading to writing bad entries.  Ticket 54.\n\n- fix issues with distcc/ccache (ticket 55) so that they actually work.\n\n- fix pconfig dump traceback; ticket 56.\n\n\n------------------------\npkgcore 0.2 (2007-01-22)\n------------------------\n\n- glsa pkgset will now include metadata/glsa from overlays.\n\n- pmaint script; tool for --sync'ing, doing quickpkging, moving packages\n  between repos for repository conversions. General repository maintenance.\n\n- sync subsystem: supports bzr, cvs, darcs, git, mercurial (hg), rsync,\n  and subversion.\n\n- binpkg repositories now support modification; FEATURES=buildpkg basically\n\n- binpkg contents handling is significantly faster.\n\n- pmerge:\n\n  - supports --ask (thanks to nesl247/alex heck)\n  - pmerge --replace is default now; use --noreplace for original behaviour.\n  - 'installed' set was added; is a pkgset comprised of all slotted atoms from\n    the vdb; useful for pmerge -u to enable upgrades of *everything* installed.\n  - versioned-installed set was added; useful for -e, this set is compromised\n    of exact version of everything installed.\n  - added --with-built-depends, -B; resolver defaults to ignoring 'built'\n    ebuild depends (those from vdb, from binpkgs for example), this option\n    tells it to update those depends.\n\n- xterm titles\n\n- massive resolver cleanup, and general fixes.\n\n- rewritten plugins system, register_plugins is no longer used.\n\n- paludis flat_list cache read/write support.\n\n- portage flat_list cache write support (cache used for\n  $PORTDIR/metadata/sync)\n\n- pebuild/pregen/pclone_cache: heavy UI cleanup.\n\n- pquery:\n\n  - prettier printing of depends/rdepends/post_rdepends under -v\n  - print revdep reasons\n  - now requires an arg always; previously defaulted to '*', which is\n    still supported but also accessible via --all .\n  - added --maintainers-email and --maintainers-name; use case insensitive\n    regex by default for --maintainer style options.\n\n- added repo_id atom extension; see doc/extended-atom-syntax.rst for details.\n  short version, sys-apps/portage::gentoo would match portage *only* from\n  `gentoo` repository.\n\n- overlays now combine mirror targets from their parent repository, and\n  from their own repository data.\n\n- configuration subsystem:\n\n  - configuration: lazy section refs were added (lazy_ref), useful for when\n    the object arguement needs to be instantiated rarely (syncers for\n    repositories for example).\n\n  - mke2fs (literal /etc/mke2fs.conf file) akin configuration format was\n    added, pkgcore.config.mke2fsformat.config_from_file.\n\n- expanded test coverage.\n\n- merged standalone test runner into setup.py; prefered way of running it is\n  `python setup.py test` now.\n\n- ongoing portage configuration support additions-\n\n  - FEATURES=collision-protect support\n  - INSTALL_MASK support, FEATURES noinfo, nodoc, and noman support.\n  - /etc/portage/package.* files can be directories holding seperate files\n    to collapse\n\n- gnu info regeneration trigger added.\n\n- performance improvements:\n\n  - cpython extensions of select os.path.* functionality; 20x boost for what\n    was converted over (stdlib's posix module is a bit inefficient).\n\n  - cpython extension for file io in pkgcore.util.osutils: 7x faster on ENOENT\n    cases, 4x-5x on actual reading of small files (think cache files).  If\n    iterating over lines of a file, use pkgcore.util.osutils.readlines- again,\n    faster then standard file object's equivalent- 3x reduction (7.6ms to 2.5ms\n    for full contents  reading).\n\n  - partial cpython reimplementation of atom code; mainly parsing, and\n    critical __getattr__ invocation (2+x faster parse).\n\n  - partial cpython reimplementation of depset code; strictly just parsing.\n    Faster (given), but mainly is able to do optimizations to the depset\n    cheaply that python side is heavily slowed down by- ( x ( y ) ) becomes\n    ( x y ) for example.\n\n  - chunks of restriction objects were pushed to cpython for memory reasons,\n    and bringing the instantiation cost down as low as possible (the common\n    restrict objects now are around 1-3us for new instantation, .5 to 1us\n    for getting a cached obj instead of instantiating).\n\n  - bug corrected in base repo classes identify_candidates method; should now\n    force a full walk of the repo only when absolutely required.\n\n  - chksuming now does a single walk over a file for all checksummers,\n    instead of one walk per checksummer- less disk thrashing, better\n    performance.\n\n  - vdb virtuals caching; massive performance boost via reduced IO.  Relies on\n    mtime checks of vdb pkg directories for staleness detection,\n    auto-regenerating itself as needed.\n\n- heavy profile code cleanup; should only read each common profile node once\n  now when loading up multiple profiles (pcheck).  Far easier code to read\n  in addition.\n\n- cache eclass staleness verification now relies on mtime comparison only-\n  allows for eclasses to move between repos; matches portage behaviour.\n\n- pkgcore.util.caching.*, via __force_caching__ class attr in consumers, can\n  be used to force singleton instance creation/caching (error if unhashable).\n\n- ebuild support:\n\n  - PORTAGE_ACTUAL_DISTDIR was reenabled, thus cvs/svn equivalent ebuilds are\n    usable once again.\n  - fixed pkgcore's pkgcore emulation of has_version/best_version matching\n    behaviour for old style virtuals to match portages (oddity, but ebuilds\n    rely on the goofy behaviour).\n  - various fixups to unpack function; should match portage behaviour as of\n    01/07 now.\n  - if FEATURES=test, set USE=test; if USE=test has been explicitly masked for\n    a package, disable src_test run; matches portage 2.1.2 behaviour.\n  - cleanup build directory, and unmerge directories upon finishing\n\n- filter-env now is accessible directly via python; pkgcore.ebuild.filter_env.\n  Needs further work prior to being usable for pcheck inspection of ebuilds,\n  but it's a good start.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.1.4 (2006-10-24)\n--------------------------\n\n- Compatibility with caches written by portage 2.1.2_pre3-r8.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.1.3 (2006-10-24)\n--------------------------\n\n- Always process \"|| ( a b )\" in the right order.\n\n- Fix disabling a flag in package.use.mask or package.use.force.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.1.2 (2006-10-10)\n--------------------------\n\n- Make filter_env work on hppa (and possibly more architectures) where using\n  python CFLAGS for this standalone binary does not work.\n\n- Fall back to plain text output if the TERM variable is unsupported.\n\n- Deal with dangling symlinks in binpkg repositories.\n\n- Fix expanding of incrementals (like USE) in make.defaults.\n\n- pquery: support --attr fetchables, handle extra commandline arguments as\n  -m or --expr restrictions.\n\n- USE deps once again allow setting a flag only if it is actually settable\n  on the target package.\n\n\n--------------------------\npkgcore 0.1.1 (2006-10-02)\n--------------------------\n\n- hang fix for test_filter_env\n\n- package.keywords fixes: no longer incremental, supports '*' and '~*'\n  properly\n\n- FEATURES=\"userpriv\" support works again.\n\n- pmerge repository ordering now behaves properly; prefers src ebuilds, then\n  built pkgs; -k inverts that (previously was semi-undefined)\n\n- binpkg fixes: run setup phase\n\n- replace op fixes: force seperate WORKDIR for unmerge to protect against\n  env collisions\n\n- loosened category rules: allow _. chars to support cross-dev hack.\n\n- build fixes: make $A unique to avoid duplicate unpacks; force distdir\n  creation regardless of whether or not the pkg has any stated SRC_URI\n  (fixes cvs and subversion eclsas usage).  Fix sandbox execution to chdir\n  to an existent directory (sandbox will fail if ran from a nonexistent dir).\n\n- change DelayedInstantiation objects to track __class__ themselves; this\n  fixes pquery to properly shutdown when ctrl+c'd (previously could swallow\n  the interrupt due to cpython isinstance swallowing KeyboardInterrupt).\n\n\n------------------------\npkgcore 0.1 (2006-09-30)\n------------------------\n\n- Initial release.\n\n- Sync functionality doesn't yet exist (pmaint script will be in 0.2)\n\n- pmerge vdb modification requires --force; this will be disabled in 0.2,\n  mainly is in place so that folks who are just looking, don't inadvertantly\n  trigger an actual modification.\n\n- not all portage FEATURES are implemented; same for QA.\n\n- If overlays are in use, pkgcore may defer to its' seperate cache to avoid\n  pkgcore causing cache regen for portage (and vice versa); this occurs due\n  to pkgcore treating overlays as their own repo and combining them at a\n  higher level; portage smushes them all together thus rendering each subtree\n  unusable in any standalone fashion.\n\n- pkgcore is far more anal about blocking bad behaviour in ebuilds during\n  metadata regeneration; tree is clean, but if you do something wrong in\n  global scope, it *will* catch it and block it.\n\n- EBD; daemonized ebuild.sh processing (effectively), pkgcore reuses old\n  ebuild.sh processes to avoid bash startup, speeding regen up by roughly\n  2x.\n",

This experimental functionality is currently\n  only enabled if  the ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER`` environment variable is set to\n  \"natural\". In the future, this behavior may become default, but only after\n  it has matured and seen substantial adoption. The ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER``\n  also accepts \"executable\" to force the default behavior of creating launcher\n  executables.\n* Issue 63: Bootstrap script (ez_setup.py) now prefers Powershell, curl, or\n  wget for retrieving the Setuptools tarball for improved security of the\n  install. The script will still fall back to a simple ``urlopen`` on\n  platforms that do not have these tools.\n* Issue 65: Deprecated the ``Features`` functionality.\n* Issue 52: In ``VerifyingHTTPSConn``, handle a tunnelled (proxied)\n  connection.\n\nBackward-Incompatible Changes\n=============================\n\nThis release includes a couple of backward-incompatible changes, but most if\nnot all users will find 1.0 a drop-in replacement for 0.9.\n\n* Issue 50: Normalized API of environment marker support.

Note that this\n  change means that all of a namespace package's ``__init__.py`` files must\n  include a ``declare_namespace()`` call in order to ensure that they will be\n  handled properly at runtime. In 2.x it was possible to get away without\n  including the declaration, but only at the cost of forcing namespace\n  packages to be imported early, which 3.0 no longer does.\n* Issue 148: When building (bdist_egg), setuptools no longer adds\n  ``__init__.py`` files to namespace packages. Any packages that rely on this\n  behavior will need to create ``__init__.py`` files and include the\n  ``declare_namespace()``.\n* Issue 7: Setuptools itself is now distributed as a zip archive in addition to\n  tar archive. ez_setup.py now uses zip archive.

If the version\n  is 3.0 or 3.1 it uses the plone install recipe, otherwise it uses the Plone\n  egg from the cheeseshop.\n  [MatthewWilkes]\n\n* Link to appropriate PyPI pages for recipes used.\n  [MatthewWilkes]\n\n* Add a Zope 2 without Plone buildout template.\n  [evilbungle]\n\n* Reconciling HISTORY.txt to mirror what can be found at the following:\n  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZopeSkel/2.10. Release of 2.10 was clobbered\n  due to what looks like a merge at r74790.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Update plone2.5_template's buildout.cfg_tmpl to use Zope 2.9.10. This\n  release incorporates Hotfix-2008-08-12. Defaulting to a known insecure\n  Zope seems unwise for people that may be updating legacy environments into\n  buildout, since they're likely to forget to include the hotfix. Url to\n  2.9.10 hard-coded (as opposed to the more elegantly self-aware\n  plone.recipe.plone approach) per the practice of a plone.recipe.distros\n  plone part.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Nearly at the end of the creation of a ZopeSkel template, the local\n  commands available for that template are displayed.\n  [jaraco, markvl]\n\n* The Plone template now has local commands. (Basically moved them\n  from the archetype templates to plone templates and made them\n  available for both.\n  [markvl]\n\n* Added base test setup to the archetype template. Added wiring code that\n  runs README.txt as a doctest.\n  [esartor]\n\n* Added tests to the addcontent contenttype command. These ammend the\n  README.txt file for each content type providing basic tests for creating,\n  editing and removing instances of the added content type.\n  [esartor]\n\n\n",
