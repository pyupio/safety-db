This change greatly increases the security of ciphertext by ensuring it hasn't been modified or tampered with maliciously. One-time pad ciphertext is maleable, so without hmac validation it can be changed to successfully allow decryption but return the wrong plaintext. These functions are the highest level abstractions of the library for encryption/decryption, which made them excellent targets for this important security update. As well, it isn't easily possible for the library to provide hmac codes for generators that produce ciphertext, because the end of a stream of ciphertext isn't known until after the results have left the scope of library code. So users will need to produce their own hmac codes for generator ciphertext unless we find an elegant solution to this issue. These functions now all return dictionaries with the associated hmac stored in the 'hmac' entry. The bytes functions formerly returned lists, now their ciphertext is available from the '\"ciphertext\"' entry. And, all database files will have an hmac attached to them now.

It also had a permission that restricted which users could read those encrypted tags.  It did NOT have a permission that restricted which users could modify encrypted tags.\r\n\r\n*It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to collins 2.1.0 if you are using the encrypted tags feature, as well as rotate any values stored in encrypted tags.*\r\n\r\nThe severity of this vulnerability depends heavily upon how you use collins in your infrastructure.  If you do not use the encrypted tags feature, you are not vulnerable to this problem.  If you do use the encrypted tags feature, you will need to explore your automation and consider how vulnerable you are.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, your infrastructure has automation that regularly sets the root password on servers to match a value that is in collins, an attacker without the ability to read the current password could set it to a value that they know, wait for the automation to change the password, and then gain root on a server.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible with collins v2.0.0, though once you upgrade it will stop any writes to encrypted tags by users that have not been granted `feature.canWriteEncryptedTags` permission.  We have also renamed `feature.canSeePasswords` to `feature.canSeeEncryptedTags`, but collins will continue to respect the value of `feature.canSeePasswords` if `feature.canSeeEncryptedTags` is not set.

The password is stored in the session when the user submits their username and password, and is removed once they complete authentication by entering a two-factor authentication code. This means that the password is stored in clear text in the session for an arbitrary amount of time, and potentially forever if the user begins the login process by entering their username and password and then leaves before entering their two-factor authentication code. The severity of this issue depends on which type of session storage you have configured: in the worst case, if you're using Django's default database session storage, then users' passwords are stored in clear text in your database. In the best case, if you're using Django's signed cookie session, then users' passwords are only stored in clear text within their browser's cookie store. In the common case of using Django's cache session store, the users' passwords are stored in clear text in whatever cache storage you have configured (typically Memcached or Redis). This has been fixed in 1.12. After upgrading, users should be sure to delete any clear text passwords that have been stored. For example, if you're using the database session backend, you'll likely want to delete any session record from the database and purge that data from any database backups or replicas. In addition, affected organizations who have suffered a database breach while using an affected version should inform their users that their clear text passwords have been compromised. All organizations should encourage users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords on any sites where they were used. As a workaround, wwitching Django's session storage to use signed cookies instead of the database or cache lessens the impact of this issue, but should not be done without a thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs of using signed cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way to fully mitigate the issue without upgrading. See: CVE-2020-15105.",

All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0. See CVE-2021-21238.",

If the file is too small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has fewer bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates.

This is because the allocator used to return the buffer data is not marked as returning an opaque handle since the needed virtual method is not overridden.

Allowing HTML within help text is an intentional design decision by Django; however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made available to editor-level users. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.4 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.9.3 (for the current 2.9 branch). In these versions, help text will be escaped to prevent the inclusion of HTML tags. Site owners who wish to re-enable the use of HTML within help text (and are willing to accept the risk of this being exploited by editors) may set WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML = True in their configuration settings. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can secure their form page templates by rendering forms field-by-field as per Django's documentation, but omitting the |safe filter when outputting the help text.
