Thanks to zifot for the suggestion.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved handle_facet_parameters call into FacetField's __init__. [Travis\n  Cline]\n\n- Updated the pysolr dependency docs & added a debugging note about\n  boost support. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Starting the beta. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug with ``FacetedSearchForm`` where ``cleaned_data`` may not\n  exist. Thanks to imageinary for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to build epub versions of the docs. [Alfredo]\n\n- Clarified that the current supported version of Whoosh is the 1.1.1+\n  series. Thanks to glesica for the report & original patch! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- The SearchAdmin now correctly uses SEARCH_VAR instead of assuming\n  things. [Rob Hudson]\n\n- Added the ability to \"weight\" individual fields to adjust their\n  relevance. [David Sauve]\n\n- Fixed facet fieldname lookups to use the proper fieldname. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Removed unneeded imports from the Solr backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Further revamping of faceting. Each field type now has a faceted\n  variant that's created either with ``faceted=True`` or manual\n  initialization. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This should also make user-created field types possible, as many of the gross ``isinstance`` checks were removed.\n\n- Fixes SearchQuerySet not pickleable. Patch by oyiptong, tests by\n  toastdriven. [oyiptong]\n\n- Added the ability to remove objects from the index that are no longer\n  in the database to the ``update_index`` management command. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added a ``range`` filter type. Thanks to davisp & lukesneeringer for\n  the suggestion! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Note that integer ranges are broken on the current Whoosh (1.1.1). However, date & character ranges seem to work fine.\n\n- Consistency. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Ensured that multiple calls to ``count`` don't result in multiple\n  queries. Thanks to Nagyman and others for the report! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Ensure that when fetching the length of a result set that the whole\n  index isn't consumed (especially on Whoosh & Xapian). [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Really fixed dict ordering bugs in SearchSite. [Travis Cline]\n\n- Changed how you query for facets and how how they are presented in the\n  facet counts.  Allows customization of facet field names in indexes.\n  [Travis Cline]\n\n  Lightly backward-incompatible (git only).\n\n- Made it easier to override ``SearchView/SearchForm`` behavior when no\n  query is present. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  No longer do you need to override both ``SearchForm`` & ``SearchView`` if you want to return all results. Use the built-in ``SearchView``, provide your own custom ``SearchForm`` subclass & override the ``no_query_found`` method per the docstring.\n\n- Don't assume that any pk castable to an integer should be an integer.\n  [Carl Meyer]\n\n- Fetching a list of all fields now produces correct results regardless\n  of dict-ordering. Thanks to carljm & veselosky for the report! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added notes about what is needed to make schema-building independent\n  of dict-ordering. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Sorted model order matters. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Prevent Whoosh from erroring if the ``end_offset`` is less than or\n  equal to 0. Thanks to zifot for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed insecure use of ``eval`` from the Whoosh backend. Thanks to\n  SmileyChris for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Disallow ``indexed=False`` on ``FacetFields``. Thanks to jefftriplett\n  for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ``FacetField`` & changed the way facets are processed. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n  Facet data is no longer quietly duplicated just before it goes into the index. Instead, full fields are created (with all the standard data & methods) to contain the faceted information.\n\n  This change is backward-compatible, but allows for better extension, not requiring data duplication into an unfaceted field and a little less magic.\n\n- EmptyQuerySet.facet_counts() won't hit the backend. [Chris Adams]\n\n  This avoids an unnecessary extra backend query displaying the default\n  faceted search form.\n\n- TextMate fail. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed ``__name__`` to an attribute on ``SearchView`` to work with\n  decorators. Thanks to trybik for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed some wording on the tutorial to indicate where the data\n  template should go. Thanks for the suggestion Davepar! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Merge branch 'whoosh-1.1' [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Final cleanup before merging Whoosh 1.1 branch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Final Whoosh 1.1.1 fixes. Waiting for an official release of Whoosh &\n  hand testing, then this ought to be merge-able. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Upgraded the Whoosh backend to 1.1. Still one remaining test failure\n  and two errors. Waiting on mchaput's thoughts/patches. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Mistakenly committed this change. This bug is not fixed. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Better handling of attempts at loading backends when the various\n  supporting libraries aren't installed. Thanks to traviscline for the\n  report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed random test failures from not running the Solr tests in awhile.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed mlt test to use a set comparison to eliminate failures due to\n  ordering differences. [Travis Cline]\n\n- Sped up Solr backend tests by moving away from RealTimeSearchIndex\n  since it was adding objects to Solr when loading fixtures. [Travis\n  Cline]\n\n- Automatically add ``suggestion`` to the context if\n  ``HAYSTACK_INCLUDE_SPELLING`` is set. Thanks to notanumber for the\n  suggestion! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added apollo13 to AUTHORS for the ``SearchForm.__init__`` cleanup.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Use kwargs.pop instead of try/except. [Florian Apolloner]\n\n- Added Rob to AUTHORS for the admin cleanup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed selection_note text by adding missing zero. [Rob Hudson]\n\n- Fixed full_result_count in admin search results. [Rob Hudson]\n\n- Fixed admin actions in admin search results. [Rob Hudson]\n\n- Added DevCheatSheet to \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Christchurch Art Gallery to \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Forgot to include ghostrocket as submitting a patch on the previous\n  commit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a serious bug in the ``simple`` backend that would flip the\n  object instance and class. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated Whoosh to 0.3.18. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated NASA's use of Haystack in \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed how ``ModelSearchIndex`` introspects to accurately use\n  ``IntegerField`` instead of ``FloatField`` as it was using. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added CongresoVisible to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a test to verify a previous change to the ``simple`` backend.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the new admin bits to not explode on Django 1.1. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added ``SearchModelAdmin``, which enables Haystack-based search within\n  the admin. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug when not specifying a ``limit`` when using the\n  ``more_like_this`` template tag. Thanks to symroe for the original\n  patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the error messages that occur when looking up attributes on a\n  model. Thanks to acdha for the patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added pagination to the example search template in the docs so it's\n  clear that it is supported. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed copy-paste foul in ``Installing Search Engines`` docs. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the ``simple`` backend to return ``SearchResult`` instances, not\n  just bare model instances. Thanks to Agos for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the ``clear_index`` management command to respect\n  ``--verbosity``. Thanks to kylemacfarlane for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the ``simple`` backend to only search textual fields. This\n  makes the backend work consistently across all databases and is likely\n  the desired behavior anyhow. Thanks to kylemacfarlane for the report.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the ``Highlighter`` which would double-highlight HTML\n  tags. Thanks to EmilStenstrom for the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Updated management command docs to mention all options that are\n  accepted. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the Whoosh backend to correctly clear the index when using the\n  ``RAMStorage`` backend. Thanks to kylemacfarlane for the initial\n  patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed ``SearchView`` to allow more control over how many results are\n  shown per page. Thanks to simonw for the suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Ignore ``.pyo`` files when listing out the backend options. Thanks to\n  kylemacfarlane for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added CustomMade to Who Uses.

Thanks to smccully for reporting this.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed several errors in the ``simple`` backend. Thanks to notanumber\n  for the original patch.

[Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed an error in the tutorial. Thanks to bencc for pointing this out.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a warning to the docs that ``SearchQuerySet.raw_search`` does\n  not chain. Thanks to jacobstr for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed an error in the documentation on providing fields for faceting.\n  Thanks to ghostmob for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where a field that's both nullable & faceted would error\n  if no data was provided. Thanks to LarryEitel for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a regression where the built-in Haystack fields would no longer\n  facet correctly. Thanks to traviscline for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed last code snippet on the ``SearchIndex.prepare_FOO`` docs.\n  Thanks to sk1p for pointing that out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where the schema could be built improperly if similar\n  fieldnames had different options. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added to existing tests to ensure that multiple faceted fields are\n  included in the index. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Finally added a README. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note about versions of the docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Go back to the default Sphinx theme. The custom Haystack theme is too\n  much work and too little benefit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note in the tutorial about building the schema when using\n  Solr. Thanks to trey0 for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where using ``SearchQuerySet.models()`` on an unregistered\n  model would be silently ignored. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  It is still silently ignored, but now emits a warning informing the user of why they may receive more results back than they expect.\n\n- Added notes about the ``simple`` backend in the docs. Thanks to\n  notanumber for catching the omission. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed erroneous old docs about Lucene support, which never landed.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Merge branch 'master' of github.com:toastdriven/django-haystack.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed typo in the tutorial. Thanks fxdgear for pointing that out!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug related to Unicode data in conjunction with the ``dummy``\n  backend. Thanks to kylemacfarlane for the report! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Forkinit to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Rampframe to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added other apps documentation for Haystack-related apps. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Unified the way ``DEFAULT_OPERATOR`` is setup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- You can now override ``ITERATOR_LOAD_PER_QUERY`` with a setting if\n  you're consuming big chunks of a ``SearchQuerySet``. Thanks to\n  kylemacfarlane for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved the preparation of faceting data to a\n  ``SearchIndex.full_prepare()`` method for easier overriding. Thanks to\n  xav for the suggestion! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The ``more_like_this`` tag now silently fails if things go south.\n  Thanks to piquadrat for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a fleshed out ``simple_backend`` for basic usage + testing.\n  [David Sauve]\n\n- ``SearchView.build_form()`` now accepts a dict to pass along to the\n  form. Thanks to traviscline for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the ``setup.py`` to include ``haystack.utils`` and added to the\n  ``MANIFEST.in``. Thanks to jezdez for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed date faceting in Solr. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  No more OOMs and very fast over large data sets.\n\n- Added the ``search_view_factory`` function for thread-safe use of\n  ``SearchView``. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added more to the docs about the ``SearchQuerySet.narrow()`` method to\n  describe when/why to use it. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Whoosh tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Somewhere, a reference to the old index was hanging around causing incorrect failures.\n\n- The Whoosh backed now uses the ``AsyncWriter``, which ought to provide\n  better performance. Requires Whoosh 0.3.15 or greater. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added a way to pull the correct fieldname, regardless if it's been\n  overridden or not. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs about adding new fields. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed a painful ``isinstance`` check which should make non-standard\n  usages easier. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs regarding reserved field names in Haystack. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Pushed some of the new faceting bits down in the implementation.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed unnecessary fields from the Solr schema template. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Revamped how faceting is done within Haystack to make it easier to\n  work with. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Add more sites to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in ``ModelSearchIndex`` where the ``index_fieldname``\n  would not get set. Also added a way to override it in a general\n  fashion. Thanks to traviscline for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Backend API standardization. Thanks to batiste for the report! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Removed a method that was supposed to have been removed before 1.0.\n  Oops. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to override field names within the index. Thanks to\n  traviscline for the suggestion and original patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected the AUTHORS because slai actually provided the patch. Sorry\n  about that. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refined the internals of ``ModelSearchIndex`` to be a little more\n  flexible. Thanks to traviscline for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The Whoosh backend now supports ``RamStorage`` for use with testing or\n  other non-permanent indexes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the ``Highlighter`` involving repetition and regular\n  expressions. Thanks to alanzoppa for the original patch! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the Whoosh backend when a ``MultiValueField`` is empty.\n  Thanks to alanwj for the original patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- All dynamic imports now use ``importlib``. Thanks to bfirsh for the\n  original patch mentioning this. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  A backported version of ``importlib`` is included for compatibility with Django 1.0.\n\n- Altered ``EmptySearchQuerySet`` so it's usable from templates. Thanks\n  to bfirsh for the patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added tests to ensure a Whoosh regression is no longer present.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in Whoosh where using just ``.models()`` would create an\n  invalid query. Thanks to ricobl for the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Forms with initial data now display it when used with SearchView.\n  Thanks to osirius for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- App order is now consistent with INSTALLED_APPS when running\n  ``update_index``. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs to reflect the recommended way to do imports in when\n  defining ``SearchIndex`` classes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This is not my preferred style but reduces the import errors some people experience.\n\n- Fixed omission of Xapian in the settings docs. Thanks to flebel for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Little bits of cleanup related to testing. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed an error in the docs related to pre-rendering data. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added Pegasus News to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected an import in forms for consistency. Thanks to bkonkle for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug where passing a customized ``site`` would not make it down\n  through the whole stack. Thanks to Peter Bengtsson for the report and\n  original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Bumped copyright years. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed Whoosh backend so most imports will raise the correct\n  exception. Thanks to shabda for the suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refactored Solr's tests to minimize reindexes. Runs ~50% faster.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a couple potential circular imports. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The same field can now have multiple query facets. Thanks to bfirsh\n  for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added schema for testing Solr. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a string interpolation bug when adding an invalid data facet.\n  Thanks to simonw for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the default highlighter to give slightly better results,\n  especially with short strings. Thanks to RobertGawron for the original\n  patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed the ``rebuild_index`` command so it can take all options that\n  can be passed to either ``clear_index`` or ``update_index``. Thanks to\n  brosner for suggesting this. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ``--noinput`` flag to ``clear_index``. Thanks to aljosa for the\n  suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the example in the template to be a little more real-world and\n  user friendly. Thanks to j0hnsmith for pointing this out. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug with the Whoosh backend where scores weren't getting\n  populated correctly. Thanks to horribtastic for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Changed ``EmptySearchQuerySet`` so it returns an empty list when\n  slicing instead of mistakenly running queries. Thanks to askfor for\n  reporting this bug. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Switched ``SearchView`` & ``FacetedSearchView`` to use\n  ``EmptySearchQuerySet`` (instead of a regular list) when there are no\n  results. Thanks to acdha for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added RedditGifts to \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Winding Road to \"Who Uses\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ryszard's full name to AUTHORS. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added initialization bits to part of the Solr test suite. Thanks to\n  notanumber for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started the 1.1-alpha work. Apologies for not doing this sooner.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added an advanced setting for disabling Haystack's initialization in\n  the event of a conflict with other apps. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered ``SearchForm`` to use ``.is_valid()`` instead of ``.clean()``,\n  which is a more idiomatic/correct usage. Thanks to askfor for the\n  suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added MANIFEST to ignore list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Django 1.0 compatibility when using the Solr backend. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Marked Haystack as 1.0 final. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Incorrect test result from changing the documented way the\n  ``highlight`` template tag gets called. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the example in faceting documentation to provide better\n  results and explanation on the reasoning. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added further documentation about\n  ``SearchIndex``/``RealTimeSearchIndex``. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs about `SearchQuerySet.highlight`. [toastdriven]\n\n- Added further docs on `RealTimeSearchIndex`. [toastdriven]\n\n- Added documentation on the ``RealTimeSearchIndex`` class.\n  [toastdriven]\n\n- Fixed the documentation for the arguments on the `highlight` tag.\n  Thanks to lucalenardi for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed tutorial to mention where the `NoteSearchIndex` should be\n  placed. Thanks to bkeating for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Marked Haystack as 1.0.0 release candidate 1. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Haystack now requires Whoosh 0.3.5. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Last minute documentation cleanup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation about the management commands that come with\n  Haystack. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs on the template tags included with Haystack. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added docs on highlighting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed some unneeded legacy code that was causing conflicts when\n  Haystack was used with apps that load all models (such as `django-\n  cms2`, `localemiddleware` or `django-transmeta`). [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed old code from the `update_index` command. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered spelling suggestion test to something a little more\n  consistent. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added tests for slicing the end of a `RelatedSearchQuerySet`. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed case where `SearchQuerySet.more_like_this` would fail when using\n  deferred Models. Thanks to Alex Gaynor for the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added default logging bits to prevent \"No handlers found\" message.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE: Renamed `reindex` management command to\n  `update_index`, renamed `clear_search_index` management command to\n  `clear_index` and added a `rebuild_index` command to both clear &\n  reindex. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE: `SearchIndex` no longer hooks up\n  `post_save/post_delete` signals for the model it's registered with.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  If you use `SearchIndex`, you will have to manually cron up a `reindex` (soon to become `update_index`) management command to periodically refresh the data in your index.\n\n  If you were relying on the old behavior, please use `RealTimeSearchIndex` instead, which does hook up those signals.\n\n- Ensured that, if a `MultiValueField` is marked as `indexed=False` in\n  Whoosh, it ought not to post-process the field. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Ensured data going into the indexes round-trips properly. Fixed\n  `DateField`/`DateTimeField` handling for all backends and\n  `MultiValueField` handling in Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a customizable `highlight` template tag plus an underlying\n  `Highlighter` implementation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added more documentation about using custom `SearchIndex.prepare_FOO`\n  methods. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- With Whoosh 0.3.5+, the number of open files is greatly reduced.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected example in docs about `RelatedSearchQuerySet`. Thanks to\n  askfor for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered `SearchResult` objects to fail gracefully when the\n  model/object can't be found. Thanks to akrito for the report. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where `auto_query` would fail to escape strings that\n  pulled out for exact matching. Thanks to jefftriplett for the report.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Brick Design to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated backend support docs slightly. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to combine `SearchQuerySet`s via `&` or `|`. Thanks\n  to reesefrancis for the suggestion. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Revised the most of the tutorial. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Better documented how user-provided data should be sanitized. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fleshed out the `SearchField` documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed formatting on ``SearchField`` documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added basic ``SearchField`` documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  More information about the kwargs and usage will be eventually needed.\n\n- Bumped the `ulimit` so Whoosh tests pass consistently on Mac OS X.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the `default` kwarg in `SearchField` (and subclasses) to work\n  properly from a user's perspective. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE: Fixed ``raw_search`` to cooperate when\n  paginating/slicing as well as many other conditions. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This no longer immediately runs the query, nor pokes at any internals. It also now takes into account other details, such as sorting & faceting.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the Whoosh backend where slicing before doing a hit\n  count could cause strange results when paginating. Thanks to\n  kylemacfarlane for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The Whoosh tests now deal with the same data set as the Solr tests and\n  cover various aspects better. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started to pull out the real-time, signal-based updates out of the\n  main `SearchIndex` class. Backward compatible for now. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed docs to include `utils` documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated instructions for installing `pysolr`. Thanks to sboisen for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added acdha to AUTHORS for previous commit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added exception handling to the Solr Backend to silently fail/log when\n  Solr is unavailable. Thanks to acdha for the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- The `more_like_this` tag is now tested within the suite. Also has lots\n  of cleanup for the other Solr tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- On both the Solr & Whoosh backends, don't do an update if there's\n  nothing being updated. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved Haystack's internal fields out of the backends and into\n  `SearchIndex.prepare`. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This is both somewhat more DRY as well as a step toward Haystack being useful to non-Django projects.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the `build_schema` where fields that aren't supposed to\n  be indexed are still getting post-procesed by Solr. Thanks to Jonathan\n  Slenders for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added HUGE to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug in Whoosh where it would always generate spelling\n  suggestions off the full query even when given a different query\n  string to check against. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Simplified the SQ object and removed a limitation on kwargs/field\n  names that could be passed in. Thanks to traviscline for the patch.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation on `should_update` fixed to match the new signature.\n  Thanks to kylemacfarlane for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed missing words in Best Practices documentation. Thanks to\n  frankwiles for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The `update_object` method now passes along kwargs as needed to the\n  `should_update` method. Thanks to askfor for the suggestion. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs about the removal of the Whoosh fork. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed extraneous `BadSearchIndex3` from test suite. Thanks\n  notanumber! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- We actually want `repr`, not `str`. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Pushed the `model_attr` check lower down into the `SearchField` and\n  make it occur later, so that exceptions come at a point where Django\n  can better deal with them. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed attempting to access an invalid `model_attr`. Thanks to\n  notanumber for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added SQ objects (replacing the QueryFilter object) as the means to\n  generate queries/query fragments. Thanks to traviscline for all the\n  hard work. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  The SQ object is similar to Django's Q object and allows for arbitrarily complex queries. Only backward incompatible if you were relying on the SearchQuery/QueryFilter APIs.\n\n- Reformatted debugging docs a bit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added debugging information about the Whoosh lock error. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Brought the TODO up to date. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a warning to the documentation about how `__startswith` may not\n  always provide the expected results. Thanks to codysoyland for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added debugging documentation, with more examples coming in the\n  future. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a new `basic_search` view as a both a working example of how to\n  write traditional views and as a thread-safe view, which the class-\n  based ones may/may not be. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed sample template in the documentation. Thanks to lemonad for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated documentation to include a couple more Sphinx directives.\n  Index is now more useful. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Made links more obvious in documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added an `example_project` demonstrating how a sample project might be\n  setup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed `load_backend` to use the argument passed instead of always the\n  `settings.HAYSTACK_SEARCH_ENGINE`. Thanks to newgene for the report.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Regression where sometimes `narrow_queries` got juggled into a list\n  when it should be a set everywhere. Thanks tcline & ericholscher for\n  the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the Whoosh backend's version requirement to reflect the fully\n  working version of Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- With the latest SVN version of Whoosh (r344), `SearchQuerySet()` now\n  works properly in Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a `FacetedModelSearchForm`. Thanks to mcroydon for the original\n  patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added translation capabilities to the `SearchForm` variants. Thanks to\n  hejsan for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added AllForLocal to Who Uses. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- The underlying caching has been fixed so it no longer has to fill the\n  entire cache before it to ensure consistency. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This results in significantly faster slicing and reduced memory usage. The test suite is more complete and ensures this functionality better.\n\n  This also removes `load_all_queryset` from the main `SearchQuerySet` implementation. If you were relying on this behavior, you should use `RelatedSearchQuerySet` instead.\n\n- Log search queries with `DEBUG = True` for debugging purposes, similar\n  to what Django does. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated LJ's Who Uses information. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Sunlight Labs & NASA to the Who Uses list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Eldarion to the Who Uses list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- When more of the cache is populated, provide a more accurate `len()`\n  of the `SearchQuerySet`. This ought to only affect advanced usages,\n  like excluding previously-registered models or `load_all_queryset`.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where `SearchQuerySet`s longer than `REPR_OUTPUT_SIZE`\n  wouldn't include a note about truncation when `__repr__` is called.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to choose which site is used when reindexing. Thanks\n  to SmileyChris for pointing this out and the original patch. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the lack of a `__unicode__` method on `SearchResult` objects.\n  Thanks to mint_xian for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Typo'd the setup.py changes. Thanks to jlilly for catching that.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Converted all query strings to Unicode for Whoosh. Thanks to simonw108\n  for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added template tags to `setup.py`. Thanks to Bogdan for pointing this\n  out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added two more tests to the Whoosh backend, just to make sure. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected the way Whoosh handles `order_by`. Thanks to Rowan for\n  pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- For the Whoosh backend, ensure the directory is writable by the\n  current user to try to prevent failed writes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a better label to the main search form field. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Bringing the Whoosh backend up to version 0.3.0b14. This version of\n  Whoosh has better query parsing, faster indexing and, combined with\n  these changes, should cause fewer disruptions when used in a\n  multiprocess/multithreaded environment. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added optional argument to `spelling_suggestion` that lets you provide\n  a different query than the one built by the SearchQuerySet. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n  Useful for passing along a raw user-provided query, especially when there is a lot of post-processing done.\n\n- SearchResults now obey the type of data chosen in their corresponding\n  field in the SearchIndex if present. Thanks to evgenius for the\n  original report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the Solr backend where submitting an empty string to\n  search returned an ancient and incorrect datastructure. Thanks kapa77\n  for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where the cache would never properly fill due to the\n  number of results returned being lower than the hit count. This could\n  happen when there were results excluded due to being in the index but\n  the model NOT being registered in the `SearchSite`. Thanks akrito and\n  tcline for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the docs to look more like the main site. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a (short) list of who uses Haystack. Would love to have more on\n  this list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed docs on preparing data. Thanks fud. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the `ModelSearchIndex` class for easier `SearchIndex`\n  generation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note about using possibly unsafe data with `filter/exclude`.\n  Thanks to ryszard for pointing this out. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Standardized the API on `date_facet`. Thanks to notanumber for the\n  original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Moved constructing the schema down to the `SearchBackend` level. This\n  allows more flexibility when creating a schema. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where a hyphen provided to `auto_query` could break the\n  query string. Thanks to ddanier for the report. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - For consistency, `get_query_set` has been\n  renamed to `get_queryset` on `SearchIndex` classes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  A simple search & replace to remove the underscore should be all that is needed.\n\n- Missed two bits while updating the documentation for the Xapian\n  backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated documentation to add the Xapian backend information. A big\n  thanks to notatnumber for all his hard work on the Xapian backend.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added `EmptySearchQuerySet`. Thanks to askfor for the suggestion!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added \"Best Practices\" documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation about the `HAYSTACK_SITECONF` setting. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed erroneous documentation on Xapian not supporting boost. Thanks\n  notanumber! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - The `haystack.autodiscover()` and other site\n  modifications now get their own configuration file and should no\n  longer be placed in the `ROOT_URLCONF`. Thanks to SmileyChris for the\n  original patch and patrys for further feedback. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added `verbose_name_plural` to the `SearchResult` object. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added a warning about ordering by integers with the Whoosh backend.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note about ordering and accented characters. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated the `more_like_this` tag to allow for narrowing the models\n  returned by the tag. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed `null=True` for `IntegerField` and `FloatField`. Thanks to\n  ryszard for the report and original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Reverted aabdc9d4b98edc4735ed0c8b22aa09796c0a29ab as it would cause\n  mod_wsgi environments to fail in conjunction with the admin on Django\n  1.1. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the start of a glossary of terminology. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Various documentation fixes. Thanks to sk1p & notanumber. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- The `haystack.autodiscover()` and other site modifications may now be\n  placed in ANY URLconf, not just the `ROOT_URLCONF`. Thanks to\n  SmileyChris for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed invalid/empty pages in the SearchView. Thanks to joep and\n  SmileyChris for patches. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a note and an exception about consistent fieldnames for the\n  document field across all `SearchIndex` classes. Thanks sk1p\\_! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Possible thread-safety fix related to registration handling. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - The 'boost' method no longer takes kwargs.\n  This makes boost a little more useful by allowing advanced terms.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  To migrate code, convert multiple kwargs into separate 'boost' calls, quote what was the key and change the '=' to a ','.\n\n- Updated documentation to match behavioral changes to MLT. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a serious bug in MLT on Solr. Internals changed a bit and now\n  things work correctly. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed erroneous 'zip_safe' from setup.py. Thanks ephelon. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added `null=True` to fields, allowing you to ignore/skip a field when\n  indexing. Thanks to Kevin for the original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a standing test failure. The dummy setup can't do `load_all` due\n  to mocking. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added initial `additional_query` to MLT to allow for narrowing\n  results. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed nasty bug where results would get duplicated due to cached\n  results. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered `ITERATOR_LOAD_PER_QUERY` from 20 to 10. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected tutorial when dealing with fields that have\n  `use_template=True`. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated documentation to reflect basic Solr setup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fix documentation on grabbing Whoosh and on the 'load_all' parameter\n  for SearchForms. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug where the '__in' filter wouldn't work with phrases or data\n  types other than one-word string/integer. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug so that the 'load_all' option in 'SearchView' now actually\n  does what it says it should. How embarrassing... [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ability to specify custom QuerySets for loading records via\n  'load_all'/'load_all_queryset'. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug where results from non-registered models could appear in\n  the results. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - Changed 'module_name' to 'model_name'\n  throughout Haystack related to SearchResult objects. Only incompatible\n  if you were relying on this attribute. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to fetch additional and stored fields from a\n  SearchResult as well as documentation on the SearchResult itself.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added the ability to look through relations in SearchIndexes via '__'.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added note about the 'text' fieldname convention. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added an 'update_object' and 'remove_object' to the SearchSite objects\n  as a shortcut. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Recover gracefully from queries Whoosh judges to be invalid. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Missed test from previous commit. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added stemming support to Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed the commented version. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Django 1.0.X compatibility fix for the reindex command. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Reindexes should now consume a lot less RAM. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Evidently, when you run a ton of queries touching virtually everything in your DB, you need to clean out the \"logged\" queries from the connection. Sad but true.\n\n- Altered `SearchBackend.remove` and `SearchBackend.get_identifier` to\n  accept an object or a string identifier (in the event the object is no\n  longer available). [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This is useful in an environment where you no longer have the original object on hand and know what it is you wish to delete.\n\n- Added a simple (read: ghetto) way to run the test suite without having\n  to mess with settings. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a setting `HAYSTACK_BATCH_SIZE` to control how many objects are\n  processed at once when running a reindex. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed import that was issuing a warning. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Further tests to make sure `unregister` works appropriately as well,\n  just to be paranoid. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bizarre bug where backends may see a different site object\n  than the rest of the application code. THIS REQUIRES SEARCH &\n  REPLACING ALL INSTANCES OF `from haystack.sites import site` TO `from\n  haystack import site`. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  No changes needed if you've been using `haystack.autodiscover()`.\n\n- Pushed save/delete signal registration down to the SearchIndex level.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This should make it easier to alter how individual indexes are setup, allowing you to queue updates, prevent deletions, etc. The internal API changed slightly.\n\n- Created a default 'clean' implementation, as the first three (and soon\n  fourth) backends all use identical code. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated tests to match new 'model_choices'. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added timeout support to Solr. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Capitalize the Models in the model_choices. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed unnecessary import. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- No longer need to watch for DEBUG in the 'haystack_info' command.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug in Whoosh backend when spelling suggestions are disabled.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a \"clear_search_index\" management command. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed comments as pysolr now supports timeouts and the other comment\n  no longer applies. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed Solr-flavored schema bits. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Still need to work out a better way to handle user created fields that don't fit neatly into subclassing one of the core Field types.\n\n- Moved informational messages to a management command to behave better\n  when using dumpdata or wsgi. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed some Solr-specific field names. Requires a reindex. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Typo'd docstring. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed empty test file from spelling testing. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation for getting spelling support working on Solr. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Initial spelling support added. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a 'more_like_this' template tag. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed an unnecessary 'run'. This cause MLT (and potentially\n  'raw_search') to fail by overwriting the results found. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added Whoosh failure. Needs inspecting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Finally added views/forms documentation. A touch rough still. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in FacetedSearchView where a SearchQuerySet method could\n  be called on an empty list instead. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More faceting documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started faceting documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs to finally include details about faceting. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Empty or one character searches in Whoosh returned the wrong data\n  structure. Thanks for catching this, silviogutierrez! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added scoring to Whoosh now that 0.1.20+ support it. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in the Solr tests due to recent changes in pysolr. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation on the 'narrow' method. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added additional keyword arguments on raw_search. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added 'narrow' support in Whoosh. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Whoosh backend's handling of pre-1900 dates. Thanks JoeGermuska!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Backed out the Whoosh quoted dates patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Something still seems amiss in the Whoosh query parser, as ranges and dates together don't seem to get parsed together properly.\n\n- Added a small requirements section to the docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added notes about enabling the MoreLikeThisHandler within Solr.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Revised how tests are done so each backend now gets its own test app.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  All tests pass once again.\n\n- Added 'startswith' filter. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the __repr__ method on QueryFilters. Thanks JoeGermuska for the\n  original patch! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE - Both the Solr & Whoosh backends now provide\n  native Python types back in SearchResults. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This also allows Whoosh to use native types better from the 'SearchQuerySet' API itself.\n\n  This unfortunately will also require all Whoosh users to reindex, as the way some data (specifically datetimes/dates but applicable to others) is stored in the index.\n\n- SearchIndexes now support inheritance. Thanks smulloni! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added FacetedSearchForm to make handling facets easier. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Heavily refactored the SearchView to take advantage of being a class.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  It should now be much easier to override bits without having to copy-paste the entire __call__ method, which was more than slightly embarrassing before.\n\n- Fixed Solr backend so that it properly converts native Python types to\n  something Solr can handle. Thanks smulloni for the original patch!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- SearchResults now include a verbose name for display purposes. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed reverse order_by's when using Whoosh. Thanks matt_c for the\n  original patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Handle Whoosh stopwords behavior when provided a single character\n  query string. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Lightly refactored tests to only run engines with their own settings.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Typo'd the tutorial when setting up your own SearchSite. Thanks\n  mcroydon! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered loading statements to only display when DEBUG is True. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Write to STDERR where appropriate. Thanks zerok for suggesting this\n  change. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - Altered the search query param to 'q' instead\n  of 'query'. Thanks simonw for prompting this change. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed the Whoosh patch in favor of better options. Please see the\n  documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added Whoosh patch for 0.1.15 to temporarily fix reindexes. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the reindex command to handle inherited models. Thanks\n  smulloni! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed the no longer needed Whoosh patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Whoosh users should upgrade to the latest Whoosh (0.1.15) as it fixes the issues that the patch covers as well as others.\n\n- Documented the 'content' shortcut. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed an incorrect bit of documentation on the default operator\n  setting. Thanks benspaulding! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation about Haystack's various settings. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected an issue with the Whoosh backend that can occur when no\n  indexes are registered. Now provides a better exception. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation fixes. Thanks benspaulding! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Whoosh patch, which should help with the \"KeyError\" exceptions\n  when searching with models. Thanks Matias Costa! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Improvements to the setup.py. Thanks jezdez & ask! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed the .gitignore. Thanks ask! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- FacetedSearchView now inherits from SearchView. Thanks cyberdelia!\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This will matter much more soon, as SearchView is going to be refactored to be more useful and extensible.\n\n- Documentation fixes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the whoosh patch. Should apply cleanly now. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Better linking to the search engine installation notes. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation on setting up the search engines. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Provide an exception when importing a backend dependency fails. Thanks\n  brosner for the initial patch. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Yay stupid typos! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Relicensing under BSD. Thanks matt_c for threatening to use my name in\n  an endorsement of a derived product! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a bug in ModelSearchForm. Closes 1. Thanks dotsphinx! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added link to pysolr binding. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refined documentation on preparing SearchIndex data. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed existing references from 'model_name' to 'module_name'.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This was done to be consistent both internally and with Django. Thanks brosner!\n\n- Documentation improvements. Restyled and friendlier intro page.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added documentation on preparing data. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Additions and re-prioritizing the TODO list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added warnings to Whoosh backend in place of silently ignoring\n  unsupported features. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected Xapian's capabilities. Thanks richardb! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - Altered all settings to be prefixed with\n  HAYSTACK\\_. Thanks Collin! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Test cleanup from previous commits. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed the DEFAULT_OPERATOR back to 'AND'. Thanks richardb! [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Altered the way registrations get handled. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Various fixes. Thanks brosner! [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added new 'should_update' method to documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added 'should_update' method to SearchIndexes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This allows you to control, on a per-index basis, what conditions will cause an individual object to reindex. Useful for models that update frequently with changes that don't require indexing.\n\n- Added FAQ docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Alter Whoosh backend to commit regardless. This avoids locking issues\n  that can occur on higher volume sites. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- A more efficient implementation of index clearing in Whoosh. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added details about settings needed in settings.py. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added setup.py. Thanks cyberdelia for prompting it. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Reindex management command now can reindex a limited range (like last\n  24 hours). Thanks traviscline. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More things to do. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation formatting fixes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added SearchBackend docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Corrected reST formatting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Additional TODO's. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Initial SearchIndex documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Formally introduced the TODO. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated backend support list. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added initial documentation for SearchSites. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed whoosh backend to fix limiting sets. Need to revisit someday.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added patch for Whoosh backend and version notes in documentation.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Initial Whoosh backend complete. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Does not yet support highlighting or scoring.\n\n- Removed some unnecessary dummy code. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Work on trying to get the default site to load reliably in all cases.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Trimmed down the urls for tests now that the dummy backend works\n  correctly. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Dummy now correctly loads the right SearchBackend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed faceting from the default SearchView. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refactored tests so they are no longer within the haystack app.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Further benefits include less mocking and haystack's tests no longer contributing overall testing of end-user apps. Documentation included.\n\n- Removed old comment. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed a potential race condition. Also, since there's no way to tell\n  when everything is ready to go in Django, adding an explicit call to\n  SearchQuerySet's __init__ to force the site to load if it hasn't\n  already. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More tests on models() support. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Pulled schema building out into the site to leverage across backends.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered backend loading for consistency with Django and fixed the\n  long-incorrect-for-non-obvious-and-tedious-reasons version number.\n  Still beta but hopefully that changes soon. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Missed a spot when fixing SearchSites. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE - Created a class name conflict during the last\n  change (double use of ``SearchIndex``). Renamed original\n  ``SearchIndex`` to ``SearchSite``, which is slightly more correct\n  anyhow. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  This will only affect you if you've custom built sites (i.e. not used ``autodiscover()``.\n\n- More documentation. Started docs on SearchQuery. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Further fleshed out SearchQuerySet documentation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE (2 of 2) - Altered autodiscover to search for\n  'search_indexes.py' instead of 'indexes.py' to prevent collisions and\n  be more descriptive. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE (1 of 2) - The ModelIndex class has been renamed\n  to be SearchIndex to make room for future improvements. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fleshed out a portion of the SearchQuerySet documentation. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- SearchQuerySet.auto_query now supports internal quoting for exact\n  matches. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed semi-serious issue with SearchQuery objects, causing bits to\n  leak from one query to the next when cloning. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Altered Solr port for testing purposes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Now that Solr and core feature set are solid, moved haystack into beta\n  status. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added simple capabilities for retrieving facets back. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Bugfix to make sure model choices don't get loaded until after the\n  IndexSite is populated. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Initial faceting support complete. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Query facets tested. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Bugfix to (field) facets. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  Using a dict is inappropriate, as the output from Solr\n  is sorted by count. Now using a two-tuple.\n\n- Backward-incompatible changes to faceting. Date-based faceting is now\n  present. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Solr implementation of faceting started. Needs more tests. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Initial faceting support in place. Needs more thought and a Solr\n  implementation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Unbreak iterables in queries. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Bugfixes for Unicode handling and loading deleted models. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed bug in Solr's run method. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Various bug fixes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Backward-Incompatible: Refactored ModelIndexes to allow greater\n  customization before indexing. See \"prepare()\" methods. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Updated \"build_solr_schema\" command for revised fields. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Refactored SearchFields. Lightly backwards-incompatible. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- No more duplicates from the \"build_solr_schema\" management command.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed the kwargs. Explicit is better than implicit. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Tests for highlighting. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added initial highlighting support. Needs tests and perhaps a better\n  implementation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started \"build_solr_schema\" command. Needs testing with more than one\n  index. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Argh. \".select_related()\" is killing reindexes. Again. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Stored fields now come back as part of the search result. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed Solr's SearchQuery.clean to handle reserved words more\n  appropriately. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Filter types seem solid and have tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- App renamed (for namespace/sanity/because it's really different\n  reasons). [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started trying to support the various filter types. Needs testing and\n  verification. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed tests in light of the change to \"OR\". [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded \"select_related\" to reindex command. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- I am a moron. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- \"OR\" is now the default operator. Also, \"auto_query\" now handles\n  not'ed keywords. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- \"More Like This\" now implemented and functioning with Solr backend.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed broken references to __name__. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Internal documentation fix. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Solr backend can now clear on a per-model basis. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Solr backend tests fleshed out. Initial stability of Solr. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n  This needs more work (as does everything) but it seems to be working reliably from my testing (both unit and \"real-world\"). Onward and upward.\n\n- Massive renaming/refactoring spree. Tests 100% passing again. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Renamed BaseSearchQuerySet to SearchQuerySet. Now requires\n  instantiation. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Standardizing syntax. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Backend support update. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- An attempt to make sure the main IndexSite is always setup, even\n  outside web requests. Also needs improvement. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Reindexes now work. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Some painful bits to make things work for now. Needs improvement.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Support kwargs on the search. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Move solr backend tests in prep for fully testing the backend. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Some ContentField/StoredField improvements. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n  StoredFields now have a unique template per field (as they should have from the start) and there's a touch more checking. You can also now override the template name for either type of field.\n\n- Fixed backend loading upon unpickling SearchBackend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Tweak internal doc. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- MOAR DOCS. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Internal documentation and cleanup. Also alters the behavior of\n  SearchQuerySet's \"order_by\" method slightly, bringing it more in-line\n  with QuerySet's behavior. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation/license updates. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed ModelIndexes and created tests for them. 100% tests passing\n  again. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started refactoring ModelIndexes. Needs tests (and possibly a little\n  love). [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Implemented Solr's boost, clean, multiple order-by. Fixed Solr's score\n  retrieval (depends on custom pysolr) and exact match syntax. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Minor changes/cleanup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated docs and a FIXME. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- SearchView/SearchForm tests passing. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Changed BaseSearchQuery to accept a SearchBackend instance instead of\n  the class. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Better dummy implementation, a bugfix to raw_search and\n  SearchView/SearchForm tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Temporarily changed the Solr backend to ignore fields. Pysolr will\n  need a patch and then reenable this. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Merge branch 'master' of\n  ssh://danielmckenzie/home/daniel/djangosearch_refactor into HEAD.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started SearchView tests and added URLconf. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started SearchView tests and added URLconf. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added note about basic use. Needs refactoring. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Merged index.rst. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Fixed result lookups when constructing a SearchResult. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Added more docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added FIXME for exploration on Solr backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Solr's SearchQuery now handles phrases (exact match). [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- More work on the Solr backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added more imports for future test coverage. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added stubs for backend tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Documentation updates. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Refactored forms/views. Needs tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed old entries in .gitignore. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Implemented load_all. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed query result retrieval. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated documentation index and tweaked overview formatting. [Matt\n  Croydon]\n\n- Slight docs improvements. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started work on Solr backend. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Ignore _build. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Refactored documentation to format better in Sphinx. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Added _build to .gitignore. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Added sphinx config for documentation. [Matt Croydon]\n\n- Verified _fill_cache behavior. 100% test pass. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added a couple new desirable bits of functionality. Mostly stubbed.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed fixme and updated docs. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed an old reference to SearchPaginator. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Updated import paths to new backend Base* location. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Relocated base backend classes to __init__.py for consistency with\n  Django. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BaseSearchQuerySet initial API complete and all but working. One\n  failing test related to caching results. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added new (improved?) template path for index templates. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Removed SearchPaginator, as it no longer provides anything over the\n  standard Django Paginator. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added len/iter support to BaseSearchQuerySet. Need to finish getitem\n  support and test. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started to update ModelIndex. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started to alter dummy to match new class names/API. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Little bits of cleanup. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added overview of where functionality belongs in djangosearch. This\n  should likely make it's way into other docs and go away eventually.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- BaseSearchQuery now tracks filters via QueryFilter objects. Tests\n  complete for QueryFilter and nearly complete for BaseSearchQuery.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started docs on creating new backends. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started tests for BaseSearchQuery and BaseSearchQuerySet. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed site loading. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More work on the Base* classes. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started docs on creating new backends. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Yet more work on BaseSearchQuerySet. Now with fewer FIXMEs. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- More work on BaseSearchQuerySet and added initial BaseSearchQuery\n  object. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed another chunk of SearchPaginator as SearchQuerySet becomes\n  more capable. Hopefully, SearchPaginator will simply go away soon.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fixed ModelSearchForm to check the site's registered models. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Reenabled how other backends might load. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ignores. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started documenting what backends are supported and what they can do.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More work on SearchQuerySet. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- More renovation and IndexSite's tests pass 100%. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Fleshed out sites tests. Need to setup environment in order to run\n  them. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Started adding tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- First blush at SearchQuerySet. Non-functional, trying to lay out API\n  and basic funationality. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed old results.py in favor of the coming SearchQuerySet. [Daniel\n  Lindsley]\n\n- Noted future improvements on SearchPaginator. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Removed old reference to autodiscover and added default site a la NFA.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Commented another use of RELEVANCE. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Little backend tweaks. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added autodiscover support. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded management command. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added SearchView and ModelSearchForm back in. Needs a little work.\n  [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded results. Need to look at SoC for ideas. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded paginator. Needs docs/tests. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Readded core backends + solr. Will add others as they reach 100%\n  functionality. [Daniel Lindsley]\n\n- Added ModelIndex back in. Customized to match new setup.

If this is used the sector\n  organisation can set the risk priority directly, and the risk will be skipped\n  during evaluation.\n\n- Modify handling of profile questions in the client: include the profile\n  question in the survey tree to make the naming more intuitive for users.\n\n- Add a new *obsolete* flag to survey groups. When a survey with this flag is\n  set is published it will be put into a new group of obsolete surveys in the\n  client. This addresses part of `TNO ticket 200\n  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/200>`_.\n\n- Make it possible to edit the survey group title from a survey edit screen.\n  This addresses part of `TNO ticket 200\n  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/200>`_.\n\n- Add page number to RTF reports. This fixes\n  `TNO ticket 241 <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/241>`_.\n\n- For OSHA, show the legend only in the identification phase.\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Security fix: modify client to always check if a survey session belongs\n  to the current user.\n\n- Fixed a typo in the client splash page. OSHA ticket 7261.\n\n- Translation updates:\n\n  - Add Bulgarian help headers. OSHA ticket 7317.\n\n  - Add Portuguese translations of the splash page. OSHA ticket 7870.\n\n  - Translate ``label_keep_logged_in`` on the client login page. OSHA ticket 7823.\n\n  - Several minor translation fixes and updates. OSHA tickets 7830, 7766,\n    7810, 7829 and 8369.\n\n  - Kosovo, Montenegro and Republic of Serbia are now translatable, and add\n    bulgarian translations. OSHA ticket 7808.\n\n  - Greek translation fixes. OSHA ticket 7704\n\n  - Portugese translation fixes. OSHA ticket 7934\n\n  - Applied new translations in 15 languages. OSHA tickets 7938, 8190, 8780\n\n  - Added MIT Licensed script to display browser warning so that we can support\n    translations. This addresses part of `OSHA ticket 7847\n    <https://projects.syslab.com/issues/7847>`_ and\n    `OSHA ticket 7929 <https://projects.syslab.com/issues/7929`_.\n\n  - Added missing CA translations in the \"ancient browser\" warnings.

    "gevent": [
        {
            "changelog": "==================\n\nIncompatible Changes\n--------------------\n- Support for Python 2.6 has been removed. See :pr:`766`.\n- Remove module ``gevent.coros`` which was replaced by ``gevent.lock``\n  and has been deprecated since 1.0b2.\n- The internal implementation modules ``gevent.corecext`` and\n  ``gevent.corecffi`` have been moved. Please import from\n  ``gevent.core`` instead.\n\nLibraries\n---------\n\n- Update libev to version 4.22.\n- Update tblib to 1.3.0.\n- Update c-ares to version 1.11.0 (`release notes\n  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-ares/c-ares/cares-1_11_0/RELEASE-NOTES>`_).\n- For the benefit of downstream package maintainers, gevent is now\n  tested with c-ares and libev linked dynamically and not embedded\n  (i.e., using the system libraries). However, only the versions\n  shipped with gevent are tested and known to work.\n- PyPy/CFFI: The corecffi native extension is now only built at\n  installation time. Previously, if it wasn't available, a build was\n  attempted at every import. This could lead to scattered \"gevent\"\n  directories and undependable results.\n- Update Cython to 0.24.\n- setuptools is now required at build time on all platforms.\n  Previously it was only required for Windows and PyPy.\n- POSIX: Don't hardcode ``/bin/sh`` into the configuration command\n  line, instead relying on ``sh`` being on the ``PATH``, as\n  recommended by `the standard <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html>`_.\n  Fixed in :pr:`809` by Fredrix Fornwall.\n\n\nSecurity\n--------\n- :mod:`gevent.pywsgi` now checks that the values passed to\n  ``start_response`` do not contain a carriage return or newline in\n  order to prevent HTTP response splitting (header injection), raising\n  a :exc:`ValueError` if they do. See :issue:`775`.\n- Incoming headers containing an underscore are no longer placed in\n  the WSGI environ. See :issue:`819`.\n- Errors logged by :class:`~gevent.pywsgi.WSGIHandler` no\n  longer print the entire WSGI environment by default. This avoids\n  possible information disclosure vulnerabilities. Applications can\n  also opt-in to a higher security level for the WSGI environment if they\n  choose and their frameworks support it. Originally reported\n  in :pr:`779` by sean-peters-au and changed in :pr:`781`.\n\n\nStdlib Compatibility\n--------------------\n- The modules :mod:`gevent.os`, :mod:`gevent.signal` and\n  :mod:`gevent.select` export all the attributes from their\n  corresponding standard library counterpart.\n- If :func:`gevent.select.select` is given a negative *timeout*\n  argument, raise an exception like the standard library does.\n- If :func:`gevent.select.select` is given closed or invalid\n  file descriptors in any of its lists, raise the appropriate\n  ``EBADF`` exception like the standard library does. Previously,\n  libev would tend to return the descriptor as ready. In the worst\n  case, this adds an extra system call, but may also reduce latency if\n  descriptors are ready at the time of entry.\n- :class:`selectors.SelectSelector` is properly monkey-patched\n  regardless of the order of imports. Reported in :issue:`835` by\n  Przemys\u0142aw W\u0119grzyn.\n- :meth:`gevent.select.poll.unregister` raises an exception if *fd* is not\n  registered, like the standard library.\n- :meth:`gevent.select.poll.poll` returns an event with\n  ``POLLNVAL`` for registered fds that are invalid. Previously it\n  would tend to report both read and write events.\n- Python 2: ``reload(site)`` no longer fails with a ``TypeError`` if\n  gevent has been imported. Reported in :issue:`805` by Jake Hilton.\n- Python 2: ``sendall`` on a non-blocking socket could spuriously fail\n  with a timeout.\n- ``FileObjectPosix`` exposes the ``read1`` method when in read mode,\n  and generally only exposes methods appropriate to the mode it is in.\n- ``FileObjectPosix`` supports a *bufsize* of 0 in binary write modes.\n  Reported in :issue:`840` by Mike Lang.\n- Python 3: meth:`gevent.socket.connect_ex` was letting\n  ``BlockingIOError`` (and possibly others) get raised instead of\n  returning the errno due to the refactoring of the exception\n  hierarchy in Python 3.3. Now the errno is returned. Reported in\n  :issue:`841` by Dana Powers.\n- Setting SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL after :mod:`gevent.subprocess`\n  had been used previously could not be reversed, causing\n  ``Popen.wait`` and other calls to hang. Now, if SIGCHLD has been\n  ignored, the next time :mod:`gevent.subprocess` is used this will be\n  detected and corrected automatically. (This potentially leads to\n  issues with :func:`os.popen` on Python 2, but the signal can always\n  be reset again. Mixing the low-level process handling calls,\n  low-level signal management and high-level use of\n  :mod:`gevent.subprocess` is tricky.) Reported in :issue:`857` by\n  Chris Utz.\n\nOther Changes\n-------------\n\n- :class:`~.Group` and :class:`~.Pool` now return whether\n  :meth:`~.Group.join` returned with an empty group. Suggested by Filippo Sironi in\n  :pr:`503`.\n- Servers: Default to AF_INET6 when binding to all addresses (e.g.,\n  \"\"). This supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connections (except on\n  Windows). Original change in :pr:`495` by Felix Kaiser.\n- Unhandled exception reports that kill a greenlet now include a\n  timestamp. See :issue:`137`.\n- Add :class:`gevent.threadpool.ThreadPoolExecutor` (a\n  :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` variant that always\n  uses native threads even when the system has been monkey-patched)\n  on platforms that have ``concurrent.futures``\n  available (Python 3 and Python 2 with the ``futures`` backport\n  installed). This is helpful for, e.g., grpc. Reported in\n  :issue:`786` by Markus Padourek.\n- Native threads created before monkey-patching threading can now be\n  joined. Previously on Python < 3.4, doing so would raise a\n  ``LoopExit`` error. Reported in :issue:`747` by Sergey Vasilyev.\n- pywsgi/performance: Chunks of data the application returns are no longer copied\n  before being sent to the socket when the transfer-encoding is\n  chunked, potentially reducing overhead for large responses.\n- :class:`~.PriorityQueue` now ensures that an initial items list is a\n  valid heap. Fixed in :pr:`793` by X.C.Dong.\n- On Python 2.7.9 and above (more generally, when the SSL backport is\n  present in Python 2), :func:`gevent.ssl.get_server_certificate`\n  would raise a :exc:`ValueError` if the system wasn't monkey-patched.\n  Reported in :issue:`801` by Gleb Dubovik.\n- On Python 2.7.9 and Python 3, closing an SSL socket in one greenlet\n  while it's being read from or written to in a different greenlet is\n  less likely to raise a :exc:`TypeError` instead of a\n  :exc:`ValueError`. Reported in :issue:`800` by Kevin Chen.\n- :class:`gevent.hub.signal` (aka :func:`gevent.signal`) now verifies\n  that its `handler` argument is callable, raising a :exc:`TypeError`\n  if it isn't. Reported in :issue:`818` by Peter Renstr\u00f6m.\n- If ``sys.stderr`` has been monkey-patched (not recommended),\n  exceptions that the hub reports aren't lost and can still be caught.\n  Reported in :issue:`825` by Jelle Smet.\n- The various ``FileObject`` implementations are more consistent with\n  each other.\n\n  .. note:: Writing to the *io* property of a FileObject should be\n            considered deprecated after it is constructed.\n\n",

Previously\n  these databases worked on little endian machines with libmaxminddb but did\n  not work on big endian machines. Due to increased safety checks when reading\n  the file, these databases will no longer work on any platform. If you are\n  using one of these databases, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest\n  GeoLite2 or GeoIP2 database\n* Added pkg-config support. If your system supports it, then running `make\n  install` now installs a `libmaxminddb.pc` file for pkgconfig. Implemented by\n  Jan Vcelak.\n* Several segmentation faults found with afl-fuzz were fixed. These were\n  caused by missing bounds checking and missing data type verification checks.\n* `MMDB_get_entry_data_list` will now fail on data structures with a depth\n  greater than 512 and data structures that are cyclic. This should not\n  affect any known MaxMind DB in production. All databases produced by\n  MaxMind have a depth of less than five.\n\n\n",

A null byte may truncate the SQL when database\n   interprets it, but it still depends on how database handles it. Thanks\n   `Orange <http://blog.orange.tw>`_ for reporting this issue.\n. Removed the support to use subquery directly. Use the new\n   :func:`~mosql.util.subq` instead.\n\nAs far as we know, the two flaws can't be exploited, but we still strongly\nrecommend you to upgrade to this version.\n\nThis version, v0.10, re-passed the strictest (level=5, risk=3) sqlmap_ tests on both value and identitifer-side in the cases:\n\n- MySQL 5.6.21 with `MySQLdb <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/>`_\n  1.2.5\n- MySQL 5.6.21 with `MySQL Connector/Python\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-connector-python>`_ 2.0.2\n- PostgreSQL 9.3.5 with `Psycopg <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2>`_ 2.5.4\n\nThe Majoy Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n. The :class:`~mosql.db.Database` supports to keep connection open.\n. The :class:`~mosql.db.Database` is thread-safe now.\n. The :func:`~mosql.query.insert` supports multi-value.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.build_where` translates ``x IN ()`` into ``FALSE``.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.build_where` allows to use `pair` as key to include\n   operator.\n. The :class:`mosql.util.Statement.format` ignores false -- in bool context --\n   clause argument.\n. The :class:`mosql.util.Statement.format` raises :exc:`TypeError` if there is\n   any unused clause argument.\n. Added :meth:`mosql.util.Query.enable_echo` to echo the SQL it builds.\n\nCheck details in :class:`~mosql.db.Database` or :func:`~mosql.query.select`.\n\nThe Minor Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n. Added :func:`~mosql.util.dot`, :func:`~mosql.util.as_`,\n   :func:`~mosql.util.asc`, :func:`~mosql.util.desc`, :func:`~mosql.util.subq`,\n   and :func:`~mosql.util.in_operand`.\n. All of the patch modules in :doc:`/patches` have a ``.patch()`` method to\n   apply the patch again.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier` was split into\n   :func:`~mosql.util.identifier`, :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_as`, and\n   :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_dir`.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier` supports to use `pair` to include table\n   and column name; and\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_as` and :func:`~mosql.util.identifier_dir`\n   also supports to use `pair` to include alias or direction.\n. Renamed :exc:`~mosql.util.OptionError` to :exc:`~mosql.util.DirectionError`.\n. The :func:`~mosql.util.delimit_identifier`,\n   :data:`~mosql.util.allowed_operators`, and\n   :data:`~mosql.util.allowed_directions` don't allow to disable anymore. Use\n   :class:`~mosql.util.raw` instead.\n. The deprecated modules in `/deprecated` will be removed in 0.11.\n. Refined all the documentation.\n\n",

This experimental functionality is currently\n  only enabled if  the ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER`` environment variable is set to\n  \"natural\". In the future, this behavior may become default, but only after\n  it has matured and seen substantial adoption. The ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER``\n  also accepts \"executable\" to force the default behavior of creating launcher\n  executables.\n* Issue 63: Bootstrap script (ez_setup.py) now prefers Powershell, curl, or\n  wget for retrieving the Setuptools tarball for improved security of the\n  install. The script will still fall back to a simple ``urlopen`` on\n  platforms that do not have these tools.\n* Issue 65: Deprecated the ``Features`` functionality.\n* Issue 52: In ``VerifyingHTTPSConn``, handle a tunnelled (proxied)\n  connection.\n\nBackward-Incompatible Changes\n=============================\n\nThis release includes a couple of backward-incompatible changes, but most if\nnot all users will find 1.0 a drop-in replacement for 0.9.\n\n* Issue 50: Normalized API of environment marker support.

Note that this\n  change means that all of a namespace package's ``__init__.py`` files must\n  include a ``declare_namespace()`` call in order to ensure that they will be\n  handled properly at runtime. In 2.x it was possible to get away without\n  including the declaration, but only at the cost of forcing namespace\n  packages to be imported early, which 3.0 no longer does.\n* Issue 148: When building (bdist_egg), setuptools no longer adds\n  ``__init__.py`` files to namespace packages. Any packages that rely on this\n  behavior will need to create ``__init__.py`` files and include the\n  ``declare_namespace()``.\n* Issue 7: Setuptools itself is now distributed as a zip archive in addition to\n  tar archive. ez_setup.py now uses zip archive. This approach avoids the potential\n  security vulnerabilities presented by use of tar archives in ez_setup.py.\n  It also leverages the security features added to ZipFile.extract in Python 2.7.4.\n* Issue 65: Removed deprecated Features functionality.\n* BB Pull Request 28: Remove backport of ``_bytecode_filenames`` which is\n  available in Python 2.6 and later, but also has better compatibility with\n  Python 3 environments.\n* Issue 156: Fix spelling of __PYVENV_LAUNCHER__ variable.\n\n",

Release of 2.10 was clobbered\n  due to what looks like a merge at r74790.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Update plone2.5_template's buildout.cfg_tmpl to use Zope 2.9.10. This\n  release incorporates Hotfix-2008-08-12. Defaulting to a known insecure\n  Zope seems unwise for people that may be updating legacy environments into\n  buildout, since they're likely to forget to include the hotfix. Url to\n  2.9.10 hard-coded (as opposed to the more elegantly self-aware\n  plone.recipe.plone approach) per the practice of a plone.recipe.distros\n  plone part.\n  [andrewb]\n\n* Nearly at the end of the creation of a ZopeSkel template, the local\n  commands available for that template are displayed.\n  [jaraco, markvl]\n\n* The Plone template now has local commands. (Basically moved them\n  from the archetype templates to plone templates and made them\n  available for both.\n  [markvl]\n\n* Added base test setup to the archetype template. Added wiring code that\n  runs README.txt as a doctest.\n  [esartor]\n\n* Added tests to the addcontent contenttype command. These ammend the\n  README.txt file for each content type providing basic tests for creating,\n  editing and removing instances of the added content type.\n  [esartor]\n\n\n",
