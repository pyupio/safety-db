Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects. The policies defined in `AccessControl` severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code execution. By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope \"Manager\" role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are at risk.

One-time pad ciphertext is maleable, so without hmac validation it can be changed to successfully allow decryption but return the wrong plaintext. These functions are the highest level abstractions of the library for encryption/decryption, which made them excellent targets for this important security update. As well, it isn't easily possible for the library to provide hmac codes for generators that produce ciphertext, because the end of a stream of ciphertext isn't known until after the results have left the scope of library code. So users will need to produce their own hmac codes for generator ciphertext unless we find an elegant solution to this issue.

The bytes functions formerly returned lists, now their ciphertext is available from the '\"ciphertext\"' entry. And, all database files will have an hmac attached to them now.

TLS handshakes will thus succeed if the peer can be verified either from the user-supplied CA or the system\u2019s default trust-store. Attackers with access to a host\u2019s trust stores or able to compromise a certificate authority already in the host's trust-store (note: the attacker must also be able to spoof DNS in this case), may be able to use this issue to bypass CA pinning. An attacker could then spoof the MQTT broker, and either drop traffic and/or respond with the attacker's data, but they would not be able to forward this data on to the MQTT broker because the attacker would still need the user's private keys to authenticate against the MQTT broker.

SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys.\r\nhttps://github.com/Backblaze/b2-sdk-python/security/advisories/GHSA-p867-fxfr-ph2w",

This second login view was not modified, so the multi factor authentication can be bypassed. Users are affected if they have activated both django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin and have not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin login view. It is possible to work around the issue by overwriting the admin login route, e.g. by adding the following URL definition before the admin routes: url('admin/login/', lambda request: redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL).\r\nhttps://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/security/advisories/GHSA-3r7g-wrpr-j5g4",

        {
            "advisory": "Django Two-Factor Authentication before 1.12, stores the user's password in clear text in the user session (base64-encoded). The password is stored in the session when the user submits their username and password, and is removed once they complete authentication by entering a two-factor authentication code. This means that the password is stored in clear text in the session for an arbitrary amount of time, and potentially forever if the user begins the login process by entering their username and password and then leaves before entering their two-factor authentication code. The severity of this issue depends on which type of session storage you have configured: in the worst case, if you're using Django's default database session storage, then users' passwords are stored in clear text in your database. In the best case, if you're using Django's signed cookie session, then users' passwords are only stored in clear text within their browser's cookie store. In the common case of using Django's cache session store, the users' passwords are stored in clear text in whatever cache storage you have configured (typically Memcached or Redis). This has been fixed in 1.12. After upgrading, users should be sure to delete any clear text passwords that have been stored. For example, if you're using the database session backend, you'll likely want to delete any session record from the database and purge that data from any database backups or replicas. In addition, affected organizations who have suffered a database breach while using an affected version should inform their users that their clear text passwords have been compromised. All organizations should encourage users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords on any sites where they were used. As a workaround, wwitching Django's session storage to use signed cookies instead of the database or cache lessens the impact of this issue, but should not be done without a thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs of using signed cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way to fully mitigate the issue without upgrading. See: CVE-2020-15105.",

In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.\r\nhttps://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/security/advisories/GHSA-8h2j-cgx8-6xv7\r\nhttps://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/commit/fa7e3c996edf2d5482fff8f9d890ac2390dede4d",

There is code in FS to validate that the url specified in the next parameter is either relative OR has the same netloc (network location) as the requesting URL. This check utilizes Pythons urlsplit library. However many browsers are very lenient on the kind of URL they accept and 'fill in the blanks' when presented with a possibly incomplete URL. As a concrete example - setting http://login?next=\\\\\\github.com will pass FS's relative URL check however many browsers will gladly convert this to http://github.com. Thus an attacker could send such a link to an unwitting user, using a legitimate site and have it redirect to whatever site they want. This is considered a low severity due to the fact that if Werkzeug is used (which is very common with Flask applications) as the WSGI layer, it by default ALWAYS ensures that the Location header is absolute - thus making this attack vector mute. It is possible for application writers to modify this default behavior by setting the 'autocorrect_location_header=False'.\r\nhttps://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/e39bb04615050448c1b8ba4caa7dacc0edd3e405",

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.\r\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue31530",

This issue is not a Python implementation bug, and there are no reports that NMR researchers were specifically relying on library/glob.html. In other words, because the older documentation stated \"finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell,\" one might have incorrectly inferred that the sorting that occurs in a Unix shell also occurred for glob.glob.

This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as \"robots.txt\" requests sent by Scrapy when the \"ROBOTSTXT_OBEY\" setting is set to \"True\", or as requests reached through redirects. It's advised upgrading and using the new \"http_auth_domain\" spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you cannot upgrade to a secure version, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the \"w3lib.http.basic_auth_header\" function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the \"Authorization\" header of your request, instead of defining them globally using \"HttpAuthMiddleware\".\r\nhttps://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/security/advisories/GHSA-jwqp-28gf-p498\r\nhttp://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth\r\nhttps://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/commit/b01d69a1bf48060daec8f751368622352d8b85a6\r\nhttps://w3lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/w3lib.html#w3lib.http.basic_auth_header",

The runtime assumes that these buffers are written to before a possible read, hence they are initialized with \"nullptr\". However, by changing the buffer index for a tensor and implicitly converting that tensor to be a read-write one, as there is nothing in the model that writes to it, we get a null pointer dereference.

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative \"-1\" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the \"-1\" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue was patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). A potential workaround would be to add a custom \"Verifier\" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the \"-1\" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, it's advised upgrading to the patched code.",

The MakeEdge function creates an edge between one output tensor of the src node (given by output_index) and the input slot of the dst node (given by input_index). This is only possible if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding DataType values and comparing these for equality. However, there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays.

This results in accessing a dimension outside the rank of the input tensor in the C++ kernel implementation. However, dim_size only does a DCHECK to validate the argument and then uses it to access the corresponding element of an array.

Users having access to \"segment_ids_data\" can alter \"output_index\" and then write to outside of \"output_data\" buffer. This might result in a segmentation fault but it can also be used to further corrupt the memory and can be chained with other vulnerabilities to create more advanced exploits. The issue was patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a. A potential workaround is to add a custom \"Verifier\" to the model loading code to ensure that the segment ids are all positive, although this only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model. A similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime between inference steps. If the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.",

First, the code computes (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the 'fixed_length' value to the size of the type argument.

The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the 'out_data' pointer by 'fixed_length * sizeof (T)' bytes whereas it only copied at most 'fixed_length' bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory.",

This then results in writing to 'out(-1, bin)', which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor.",

This is because the implementation (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L85-L89) computes a divisor quantity by dividing two user controlled values. The user controls the values of `input_size[i]` and `pooling_ratio_[i]` (via the `value.shape()` and `pooling_ratio` arguments). If the value in `input_size[i]` is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results in `output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode, so in released versions of TF this does not trigger. Later, these computed values are used as arguments (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L96-L99) to `GeneratePoolingSequence`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_pool_common.cc#L100-L108).

The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative \"-1\" value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the \"-1\" index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. A potential workaround would be to add a custom \"Verifier\" to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the \"-1\" special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is error-prone, its advised upgrading to the patched code.

It occurs because the rolename is used to form the filename, and may contain path traversal characters (ie '../../name.json'). The impact is mitigated by a few facts: \r\n- It only affects implementations that allow arbitrary rolename selection for delegated targets metadata.\r\n- The attack requires the ability to A) insert new metadata for the path-traversing role and B) get the role delegated by an existing targets metadata.\r\n- The written file content is heavily restricted since it needs to be a valid, signed targets file. \r\n- The file extension is always .json. \r\nThere are no workarounds that do not require code changes. Clients can restrict the allowed character set for rolenames, or they can store metadata in files named in a way that is not vulnerable: neither of these approaches is possible without modifying python-tuf.\r\nhttps://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-wjw6-2cqr-j4qr\r\nhttps://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/commit/4ad7ae48fda594b640139c3b7eae21ed5155a102\r\nhttps://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/issues/1527",

Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk.

In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable 'VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false' or the flag '--no-render' (placed between 'vault-cli' and the subcommand, e.g. 'vault-cli --no-render get-all') or adding 'render: false' to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability.

When a header like \"Bad-header: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\x10\" is received, it will cause the regular expression engine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to use 100% CPU time and blocking any other interactions. This allows an attacker to send a single request with an invalid header and take the service offline. This issue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the regular expression was updated to attempt to match the behavior required by errata associated with RFC7230. The regular expression that was used to validate incoming headers has been updated in version 1.4.3.",

This issue has been fixed in Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to close the socket. Instead, that is always delegated to the main thread. There is no workaround for this issue, however, users using waitress behind a reverse proxy server are less likely to have issues if the reverse proxy always reads the full response.\r\nhttps://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-f5x9-8jwc-25rw",

This can lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the outbound (GET) traffic. For example, in a scenario where a single server has multiple instances of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files from any other instance to which the process has read access. If instances have individual authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering) or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in such a scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances. If the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious, they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload.

See CVE-2021-32807: The module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code used in restricted code within Zope applications. Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects. The policies defined in `AccessControl` severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code execution. By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope \"Manager\" role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are at risk. The problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2. Only AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3, not Python 2.7.
