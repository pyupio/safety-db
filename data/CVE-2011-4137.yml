cve: CVE-2011-4137
description: The verify_exists functionality in the URLField implementation in Django
  before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 relies on Python libraries that attempt access
  to an arbitrary URL with no timeout, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (resource consumption) via a URL associated with (1) a slow response,
  (2) a completed TCP connection with no application data sent, or (3) a large amount
  of application data, a related issue to CVE-2011-1521.
