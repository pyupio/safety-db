cve: CVE-2008-4126
description: 'PyDNS (aka python-dns) before 2.3.1-5 in Debian GNU/Linux does not use
  random source ports for DNS requests and does not use random transaction IDs for
  DNS retries, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof DNS responses,
  a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-1447.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
  of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4099.'
