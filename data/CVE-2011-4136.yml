cve: CVE-2011-4136
description: django.contrib.sessions in Django before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1,
  when session data is stored in the cache, uses the root namespace for both session
  identifiers and application-data keys, which allows remote attackers to modify a
  session by triggering use of a key that is equal to that session's identifier.
